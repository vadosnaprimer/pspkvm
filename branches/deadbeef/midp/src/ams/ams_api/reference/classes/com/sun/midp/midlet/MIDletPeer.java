     * bring the appropriate application to the foreground to let the

     * MUST handle only the last request made. On platforms where the

     * Application Descriptor or a JAR file), the request is
     * interpreted as a request to install the named package. In this
     * case, the platform's normal MIDlet suite installation process
     * SHOULD be used, and the user MUST be allowed to control the
     * process (including cancelling the download and/or
     * installation). If the MIDlet suite being installed is an
     * <em>update</em> of the currently running MIDlet suite, the
     * platform MUST first stop the currently running MIDlet suite
     * before performing the update. On some platforms, the currently
     * running MIDlet suite MAY need to be stopped before any
     * installations can occur.</p>
     *
     * <p>If the URL specified is of the form
     * <code>tel:&lt;number&gt;</code>, as specified in <a
     * href="http://rfc.net/rfc2806.html">RFC2806</a>, then the
     * platform MUST interpret this as a request to initiate a voice
     * call. The request MUST be passed to the &quot;phone&quot;
     * application to handle if one is present in the platform.</p>
     *
     * <p>Devices MAY choose to support additional URL schemes beyond
     * the requirements listed above.</p>
     *
     * <p>Many of the ways this method will be used could have a
     * financial impact to the user (e.g. transferring data through a
     * wireless network, or initiating a voice call). Therefore the
     * platform MUST ask the user to explicitly acknowledge each
     * request before the action is taken. Implementation freedoms are
     * possible so that a pleasant user experience is retained. For
     * example, some platforms may put up a dialog for each request
     * asking the user for permission, while other platforms may
     * launch the appropriate application and populate the URL or
     * phone number fields, but not take the action until the user
     * explicitly clicks the load or dial buttons.</p>
