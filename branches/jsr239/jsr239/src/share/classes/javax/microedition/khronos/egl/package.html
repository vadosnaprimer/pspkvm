<p> A package containing the Khronos EGL interfaces.  Although this
specification incorporates portions of the EGL documentation, the
documentation available at the <a
href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/spec">Khronos</a> Web site
should always be considered definitive.

<p> This specification defines exception behavior that is intended to
enhance platform security by preventing invalid memory accesses from
occuring in the underlying EGL implementation.  The TCK for this
specification will test for proper generation of exceptions.

<p> See the documentation for the <code>EGL10</code> interface for a
description of the integration between EGL and platform drawing APIs
such as MIDP and Personal Basis Profile.
