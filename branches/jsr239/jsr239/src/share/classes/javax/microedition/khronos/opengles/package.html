<p> A package containing the Khronos OpenGL(R) ES interfaces.
Although this specification incorporates portions of the OpenGL ES
documentation, the documentation available at the <a
href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/spec">Khronos</a> Web site
should always be considered definitive.

<p> An implementation of this specification must utilize an underlying
OpenGL ES engine that has been certified as conformant.  The TCK for
this specification will not address the conformance of the underlying
engine.

<p> The object of an implementation of this specification is to pass
the OpenGL ES command stream generated by the application to the
underlying OpenGL ES engine without any semantic alterations.  An
implementation may rewrite the command stream provided that the
resulting command stream is guaranteed by the rules of OpenGL ES to
produce identical results.  For example, a duplicate state setting may
be removed from the command stream.

<p> Because some implementations may need to reformat the image data
generated by the OpenGL ES engine in order to convert it to a format
that matches those used elsewhere in the Java platform implementation,
color values are allowed to be modified as long as no pixel is
observed to differ from the value that would be produced by an
equivalent native OpenGL ES program by more than +- 16.

<p> This specification defines exception behavior that is intended to
enhance platform security by preventing invalid memory accesses from
occuring in the underlying OpenGL ES implementation.  The TCK for this
specification will test for proper generation of exceptions.
