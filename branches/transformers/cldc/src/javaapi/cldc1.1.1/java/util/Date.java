/**
 * The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond
 * precision.
 * <p>
 * This class has been subset for the J2ME based on the JDK 1.3 Date class.
 * Many methods and variables have been pruned, and other methods
 * simplified, in an effort to reduce the size of this class.
 * <p>
 * Although the Date class is intended to reflect coordinated universal
 * time (UTC), it may not do so exactly, depending on the host environment
 * of the Java Virtual Machine. Nearly all modern operating systems assume
 * that 1 day = 24x60x60 = 86400 seconds in all cases. In UTC, however,
 * about once every year or two there is an extra second, called a "leap
 * second." The leap second is always added as the last second of the
 * day, and always on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute
 * of the year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an added leap second.
 * Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect the
 * leap-second distinction.
