/**
 *
 * There are two string-like data types in today's JDK:
 * 1) zero-terminated, C-language, ASCII strings
 * 2) Java Strings.
 * 
 * The former arise from:
 * (a) UTF encoding of Java class, method, field names and type
 *     signatures, used for linkage
 * (b) UTF encoded forms of Java String constants, used as keys
 *     for the intern-ing of said constants.
 * See the class AsciiStrings where these are manipulated
 * to achieve some sharing of runtime data structures.
 *
 * In this, the StringTable class, we keep track of Java Strings, in
 * the form of StringConstant's.
 * We enter them in a Str2ID structure, which will be wanted
 * at runtime. And we assign layout of the runtime char[] data.
 * Much aliasing of data is possible, since this is read-only and
 * not usually zero-terminated. We won't do any of that, for now.
 * There is much potential here.
