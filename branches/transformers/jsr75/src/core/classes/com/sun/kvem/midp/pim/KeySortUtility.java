     * postconditions:
     * <ul>
     * <li> keyList.size() == valueList.size()
     * <li> keyList[i] corresponds to valueList[i] (0 <= i < keyList.size())

     * <li> keyList contains key
     * <li> valueList contains value
     * <li> key corresponds to value
     * </ul>
     * The following are preconditions:
     * <ul>
     * <li> keyList.size() == valueList.size()
     * <li> keyList[i] corresponds to valueList[i] (0 <= i < keyList.size())
     * <li> keyList is in ascending order of keys

     * In order to maintain the arrays correctly, the objects passed as keyList
     * and valueList should <i>only</i> be modified by this method.
     * <p>Preconditions are not verified by this method.
