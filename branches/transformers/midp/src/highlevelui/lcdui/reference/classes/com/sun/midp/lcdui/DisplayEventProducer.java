/**
 * This class provides methods to send events of types 
 * handled by MDisplayEventConsumer I/F implementors. 
 * This class completely hide event construction & sending in its methods.
 * 
 * Generic comments for all XXXEventProducers:
 *
 * For each supported event type there is a separate sendXXXEvent() method, 
 * that gets all needed parameters to construct an event of an approprate class.
 * The method also performs event sending itself.
 *
 * If a given event type merges a set of logically different subtypes, 
 * this class shall provide separate methods for these subtypes.
 *
 * It is assumed that only one object instance of this class
 * is initialized with the system event that is created at (isolate) startup. 
 *
 * This class only operates on the event queue given to it during
 * construction, the class does not obtain any restricted object itself,
 * so it does not need protection.
 *
 * All MIDP stack subsystems that need to send events of supported types, 
 * must get a reference to an already created istance of this class. 
 * Typically, this instance should be passed as a constructor parameter.
 *
 * Class is NOT final to allow debug/profile/test/automation subsystems
 * to change, substitute, complement default "event sending" functionality :
 * Ex. 
 * class LogXXXEventProducer 
 *      extends XXXEventProducer {
 *  ...
 *  void sendXXXEvent(parameters) {
 *      LOG("Event of type XXX is about to be sent ...")
 *      super.sendXXXEvent(parameters);
 *      LOG("Event of type XXX has been sent successfully !")
 *  }
 *  ...
 * }
