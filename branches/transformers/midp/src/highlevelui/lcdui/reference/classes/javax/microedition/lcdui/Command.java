/**
 * The <code>Command</code> class is a construct that encapsulates
 * the semantic information of an action. The behavior that the command
 * activates is not encapsulated in this object. This means that command 
 * contains
 * only information about &quot;command&quot; not the actual action
 * that happens when
 * command
 * is activated. The action is defined in a 
 * {@link CommandListener CommandListener}
 * associated
 * with the <code>Displayable</code>. <code>Command</code> objects are
 * <em>presented</em>
 * in the user interface and the way they are presented
 * may depend on the semantic information contained within the command.
 *
 * <P><code>Commands</code> may be implemented in any user interface
 * construct that has
 * semantics for activating a single action. This, for example, can be a soft
 * button, item in a menu, or some other direct user interface construct.
 * For example, a
 * speech interface may present these commands as voice tags. </P>
 *
 * <P>The mapping to concrete user interface constructs may also depend on the
 * total number of the commands.
 * For example, if an application asks for more abstract commands than can
 * be mapped onto
 * the available physical buttons on a device, then the device may use an
 * alternate human interface such as a menu. For example, the abstract 
 * commands that
 * cannot be mapped onto physical buttons are placed in a menu and the label
 * &quot;Menu&quot; is mapped onto one of the programmable buttons. </P>
 *
 * <p>A command contains four pieces of information: a <em>short label</em>,
 * an optional <em>long label</em>, a
 * <em>type</em>, and a <em>priority</em>.
 * One of the labels is used for the visual
 * representation of the command, whereas the type and the priority indicate
 * the semantics of the command. </p>
 *
 * <a name="label"></a>
 * <h3>Labels</h3>
 *
 * <p> Each command includes one or two label strings.  The label strings are
 * what the application requests to be shown to the user to represent this
 * command. For example, one of these strings may appear next to a soft button
 * on the device or as an element in a menu. For command types other than
 * <code>SCREEN</code>, the labels provided may be overridden by a
 * system-specific label
 * that is more appropriate for this command on this device. The contents of
 * the label strings are otherwise not interpreted by the implementation. </p>
 * 
 * <p>All commands have a short label.  The long label is optional.  If the
 * long label is not present on a command, the short label is always used.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>The short label string should be as short as possible so that it
 * consumes a minimum of screen real estate.  The long label can be longer and
 * more descriptive, but it should be no longer than a few words.  For
 * example, a command's short label might be &quot;Play&quot;, and its
 * long label
 * might be &quot;Play Sound Clip&quot;.</p>
 *
 * <p>The implementation chooses one of the labels to be presented in the user
 * interface based on the context and the amount of space available.  For
 * example, the implementation might use the short label if the command
 * appears on a soft button, and it might use the long label if the command
 * appears on a menu, but only if there is room on the menu for the long
 * label.  The implementation may use the short labels of some commands and
 * the long labels of other commands, and it is allowed to switch between
 * using the short and long label at will.  The application cannot determine
 * which label is being used at any given time.  </p>
 *
 * <a name="type"></a>
 * <h3>Type</h3>
 *
 * <p> The application uses the command
 * type to specify the intent of this command. For example, if the
 * application specifies that the command is of type
 * <code>BACK</code>, and if the device
 * has a standard of placing the &quot;back&quot; operation on a
 * certain soft-button,
 * the implementation can follow the style of the device by using the semantic
 * information as a guide. The defined types are
 * {@link #BACK BACK},
 * {@link #CANCEL CANCEL},
 * {@link #EXIT EXIT},
 * {@link #HELP HELP},
 * {@link #ITEM ITEM},
 * {@link #OK OK},
 * {@link #SCREEN SCREEN},
 * and
 * {@link #STOP STOP}. </p>
 *
 * <a name="priority"></a>
 * <h3>Priority</h3>
 *
 * <p> The application uses the priority
 * value to describe the importance of this command relative to other commands
 * on the same screen. Priority values are integers, where a lower number
 * indicates greater importance. The actual values are chosen by the
 * application. A priority value of one might indicate the most important
 * command, priority values of two, three, four, and so on indicate commands
 * of lesser importance. </p>
 *
 * <p>Typically,
 * the implementation first chooses the placement of a command based on
 * the type of command and then places similar commands based on a priority
 * order. This could mean that the command with the highest priority is
 * placed so that user can trigger it directly and that commands with lower
 * priority are placed on a menu. It is not an error for there to be commands
 * on the same screen with the same priorities and types. If this occurs, the
 * implementation will choose the order in which they are presented. </p>
 *
 * <p>For example, if the application has the following set of commands: </P>
 * <TABLE BORDER="2">
 * <TR>
 * <TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
 *    <pre><code>
 *    new Command("Buy", Command.ITEM, 1);
 *    new Command("Info", Command.ITEM, 1);
 *    new Command("Back", Command.BACK, 1);    </code></pre>
 * </TD>
 * </TR>
 * </TABLE>
 * <P>
 * An implementation with two soft buttons may map the
 * <code>BACK</code> command to
 * the right
 * soft button and create an &quot;Options&quot; menu on the left soft
 * button to contain
 * the other commands.<BR>
 * <IMG SRC="doc-files/command1.gif" width=190 height=268><BR>
 * When user presses the left soft button, a menu with the two remaining
 * <code>Commands</code> appears:<BR>
 * <IMG SRC="doc-files/command2.gif" width=189 height=260><BR>
 * If the application had three soft buttons, all commands can be mapped 
 * to soft buttons:
 * <BR><IMG SRC="doc-files/command3.gif" width=189 height=261></P>
 *
 * <p>The application is always responsible for providing the means for the
 * user to progress through different screens. An application may set up a
 * screen that has no commands. This is allowed by the API but is generally
 * not useful; if this occurs the user would have no means to move to another
 * screen. Such program would simply considered to be in error. A typical
 * device should provide a means for the user to direct the application manager
 * to kill the erroneous application.
