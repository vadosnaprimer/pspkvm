<title>LCDUI Method Naming Conventions</title></head>

<h1>LCDUI Method Naming Conventions</h1>

<p>
LCDUI uses a set of naming conventions to guide developers as to the
locking context for each method.  For a detailed discussion of the
locking policy in LCDUI, please see the "Thread Safety" section of the
<i>Design Guide</i>.

<p>
The naming convention applies primarily to calls between the public
API (model) classes and the LF ("look and feel") classes.  However,
the convention is also applied elsewhere.

<p>
All data in LCDUI, including data in both the API classes and in the
LF classes, is protected by a monitor lock on a single object,
<code>Display.LCDUILock</code>.  This lock must be held during access,
read or write, to any class or instance variables of any API or LF
classes within LCDUI.  The monitor lock on the
<code>Display.calloutLock</code> object <em>must</em> be held by any
code that calls out to the application, whereas, the monitor lock on
LCDUILock <em>must not</em> be held across such calls.  This implies
that LCDUILock must not be held across calls to internal methods that
might call out to the application.  This further implies that there is
a mixture of code within LCDUI: some methods are called while the
monitor lock on LCDUILock is held ("locked"), and some methods are
called when it is not held ("unlocked").

<p>
The primary goal of the naming convention is therefore to distinguish
methods that are called while LCDUILock is locked from those called
while LCDUILock is unlocked.  The first convention is as follows:

<ul>
     <li>Prefix 'l'</li>
	Methods prefixed with 'l' are called while LCDUILock is
	locked.  Code within these methods has free access to LCDUI
	class and instance variables.  Code within these methods
	<em>must not</em> call out to the application.

     <li>Prefix 'u'</li>
	Methods prefixed with 'u' are called while LCDUILock is
	unlocked.  Code within these methods must first lock LCDUILock
	prior to any access to class or instance variables.   Code
	within these methods may call out to the application, but it
	may do so only while LCDUILock is not held and while
	calloutLock is held.
</ul>

<p>
Additional naming conventions describe special actions that are likely
to occur during this call that have some impact on thread safety.

<ul>
     <li>Prefix 'uCall'</li>

	A prefix of 'uCall' implies everything that the 'u' prefix
	implies, with the following additional characteristics.  Methods
	prefixed with 'uCall' are called only from the event dispatch
	thread while LCDUILock is unlocked.  These methods may end up
	calling into application code, handling LCDUILock and
	calloutLock appropriately.  A subclass may override methods
	with this prefix if it needs to perform an additional callout
	to application code.  Otherwise, it should only override the
	'lCall' version explained below.

     <li>Prefix 'lCall'</li>

	Methods prefixed with 'lCall' contain implementation code that
	is shared by 'uCall' methods.  As with other methods with the
	'l' prefix, methods prefixed with 'lCall' are called while
	LCDUILock is held.  Note that 'lCall' methods <em>do not</em>
	actually call out to the application.  They are named as such
	because they assist 'uCall' methods.  In all cases it is the
	responsibility of 'uCall' methods to perform the actual
	callout to the application.  An 'lCall' method may be
	overriden by subclass to perform additional work that does not
	involve calling out to application code.

     <li>Prefix 'lRequest'</li>

	Methods prefixed with 'lRequest' initiate some action by
	posting an asynchronous event to the event queue.  The method
	returns immediately and does not wait for the event to be
	processed.  The requested action is performed at a later time,
	when the event is processed.  As with other methods that have
	the 'l' prefix, these methods must be called while LCDUILock
	is held.
</ul>

<p>
There are a variety of methods that don't adhere to any of the
conventions described above.  Generally, these are methods internal to
an API class or an LF class, and they are called while LCDUILock is held.
