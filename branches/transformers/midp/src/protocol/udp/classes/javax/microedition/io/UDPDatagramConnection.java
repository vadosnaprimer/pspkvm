 * <p>
 * A <code>UDPDatagramConnection</code> is returned from
 * <code>Connector.open()</code> in response to a request to
 * open a <code>datagram://</code> URL connection string.
 * If the connection string omits both the <code>host</code>

 * system will allocate an available port. The local
 * address and the local port can be discovered using
 * the accessor methods within this interface.

 * The syntax described here for the datagram URL connection string
 * is also valid for the <code>Datagram.setAddress()</code> method
 * used to assign a destination address to a <code>Datagram</code>
