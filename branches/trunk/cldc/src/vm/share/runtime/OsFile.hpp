 *           OsFile_MappedFile.mapped; In this case, the entire image
 *           must be mapped read-write.
 *
 * <length>: The number of bytes to map (starting from the beginning of the
 *           file.
 *
 * <rw_offset>: from this offset on, all bytes in the file must be mapped
 *           in read-write mode. Note that rw_offset is not guaranteed
 *           to be page aligned, so the implementation may need to round
 *           down to the nearest page boundary.
 *
 * <rw_length>: In this version, it is guaranteed that
 *           rw_offset + rw_length == length.
