 * 
 * Networking functionality is not mandatory for JTWI conformance. J2ME networking defines three,
 * support client TCP sockets, Datagram UDP sockets and Server TCP sockets. The functions needed to
 * support the client TCP sockets and UDP sockets are described below. \n
 * Networking requirements is similar to a very large extent to BSD sockets. Networking functions can
 * be broadly classified into the following groups,
 * - Client TCP socket functions:
 *    - socketopen
 *    - socketclose
 *    - socket read
 *    - socket write
 *    - get local address
 *    - get local port
 *    - get remote address
 *    - get remote port
 *    - getsockopt
 *    - setsockopt
 * - Datagram functions:
 *    - datagram open
 *    - datagram close
 *    - datagram read
 *    - datagram write
 * - Misc networking functions:
 *    - Network initialization
 *    - get Last error code
 *    - get Host by Name
 *    - get Local Host Name
 *    - get Local IP Address
 *    - get Host By Address
 * 
 * \par
 * 
 * The following functions support asynchronous operation:
 * - socket open
 * - socket close
 * - socket read
 * - socket write
 * - datagram open
 * - datagram close
 * - datagram read
 * - datagram write
 * - get Host By Address
 * - get Host by Name
 *
 * \par
 * 
 * In the async case, the functions returns JAVACALL_WOULD_BLOCK instead of blocking and an
 * event is required to be sent when the operation has completed. See section on event for related
 * information.
