       C Interpreter Loop

 This is simple replacement for generated ASM interpreter loop written in 
pure C++, although in ASM-style way, to make ASM interpreter studing simpler.
We barely use any objects in it at all.

 Overall design is very similar to ASM interpreter, and the only serious difference is somewhat different thread model (we use lightweight threads but
have separate Java and C stacks). Due threading, it's not pure C, but has
minor ASM stubs (see AsmStubs_*.*). 

 Speedwise it's not optimized, and is about 3 times slower comparion to x86 ASM
interpreter loop.

 It's pretty functional now, passes minTCK1.1, and contains MVM and profiler support. The only major feature missed (and not planned to be added) is Java
debugger support.
