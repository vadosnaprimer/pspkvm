/**
 * The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond
 * precision.
 * <p>
 * This Class has been subset for the MID Profile based on JDK 1.3.
 * In the full API, the class Date had two additional functions.
 * It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour,
 * minute, and second values. It also allowed the formatting and
 * parsing of date strings. Unfortunately, the API for these functions
 * was not amenable to internationalization. As of JDK 1.1, the Calendar
 * class should be used to convert between dates and time fields and
 * the DateFormat class should be used to format and parse date strings.
 * The corresponding methods in Date are deprecated.
 * <p>
 * Although the Date class is intended to reflect coordinated universal
 * time (UTC), it may not do so exactly, depending on the host environment
 * of the Java Virtual Machine. Nearly all modern operating systems assume
 * that 1 day = 24x60x60 = 86400 seconds in all cases. In UTC, however,
 * about once every year or two there is an extra second, called a "leap
 * second." The leap second is always added as the last second of the
 * day, and always on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute
 * of the year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an added leap second.
 * Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect the
 * leap-second distinction.
