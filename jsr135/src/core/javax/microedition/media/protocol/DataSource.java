/**
 * A <CODE>DataSource</CODE> is an abstraction for media protocol-handlers.
 * It hides the details of how the data is read from source--whether 
 * the data is 
 * coming from a file, streaming server or proprietary delivery mechanism.
 * It provides the methods for a <code>Player</code> to access 
 * the input data.
 * <p>
 * An application-defined protocol can be implemented with a custom
 * <code>DataSource</code>.  A <code>Player</code> can then be
 * created for playing back the media from the custom 
 * <code>DataSource</code> using the
 * <a href="../Manager.html#createPlayer(javax.microedition.media.protocol.DataSource)">
 * <code>Manager.createPlayer</code></a> method.
 * <p>
 * There are a few reasons why one would choose to implement
 * a <code>DataSource</code> as opposed to an <code>InputStream</code>
 * for a custom protocol:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <code>DataSource/SourceStream</code> provides the random 
 * seeking API that
 * is not supported by an <code>InputStream</code>.  i.e., if 
 * the custom protocol
 * requires random seeking capabilities, a custom 
 * <code>DataSource</code> can be used.
 * <li>
 * <code>DataSource/SourceStream</code> supports the concept of 
 * transfer size
 * that is more suited for frame-delimited data, e.g. video.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A <code>DataSource</code> contains a set of <code>SourceStream</code>s.
 * Each <code>SourceStream</code> represents one elementary data stream
 * of the source.  In the most common case, a <code>DataSource</code>
 * only provides one <code>SourceStream</code>.  A <code>DataSource</code>
 * may provide multiple <code>SourceStream</code>s if it encapsulates
 * multiple elementary data streams.
 * <p>
 * Each of the <code>SourceStream</code>s provides the methods to allow
 * a <code>Player</code> to read data for processing.
 * <p>
 * <CODE>DataSource</CODE> manages the life-cycle of the media source
 * by providing a simple connection protocol.
 *
 * <p>
 * <a name="controls">
 * <code>DataSource</code> implements <code>Controllable</code> which
 * provides extra controls via some type-specific <code>Control</code>
 * interfaces.  <code>getControl</code> and <code>getControls</code>
 * can only be called when the <code>DataSource</code> is connected.
 * An <code>IllegalStateException</code> will be thrown otherwise.
