Provides the functions of the runtime management of MIDlets and suites in
 conjunction with the javax.microedition.midlet package.

<p> For security purposes the MIDletStateHandler is the anchor of trust
 internally for the MIDP API, restricted methods obtain the MIDletStateHandler
 for a MIDlet suite in order to check the properties and actions of a suite.
 Because of this, there MUST only be one a MIDlet suite per MIDletStateHandler.
</p>
<p><h2>MIDlet State Handing</h2>
</p>
<p>The MIDletStateHandler handles state transitions for a MIDlet. MIDP
 Optimized Implementation software has more states than those listed in the MIDP
 Specification (which are paused, active, and destroyed). The additional
 states are active pending, pause pending, and destroy pending. The state
 processing for a MIDlet is described in the table and illustrated in figure
 below.
</p>
<table border=2>
<tr>
  <th>State</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Active Pending</td>
  <td>The starting state. For MIDlets in this state, the MIDlet state handler
 moves the MIDlet to the active state, and calls the MIDlet's startApp
 method.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Active</td>
  <td>For MIDlets in this state, the MIDlet state handler does nothing. A
 MIDlet leaves the active state because of an event outside the MIDlet state
 handler, such as the user exiting the MIDlet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Pause Pending</td>
  <td>For MIDlets in this state, the MIDlet state handler moves the MIDlet to
 the paused state and calls the MIDlet's pauseApp method.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Paused</td>
  <td>For MIDlets in this state, the MIDlet state handler does nothing. A
 MIDlet leaves the active state because of an event outside the MIDlet state
 handler, such as the MIDlet requesting its reactivation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Destroy Pending</td>
  <td>For MIDlets in this state, the MIDlet state handler moves the MIDlet to
 the destroyed state and calls the MIDlet's destroyApp method.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Destroyed</td>
  <td>The final state. For MIDlets in this state, the MIDlet state handler
 removes the MIDlet from the list of running MIDlets.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<hr/>
<b>Note -</b> To save CPU time, if all of the running MIDlets are in either
 the paused or active state, the MIDletStateHandler stops and waits for a
 state change.

<p><h3>Pausing a MIDlet</h3>
</p>
<p>A MIDlet can be placed in paused state by either the system or itself, as
 indicated by the figure above.

A MIDlet pauses itself by calling its pauseNotify method. However, as of MIDP
 2.0 there is no longer any reason for this to happen for the following
 reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A MIDlet does not need to pause itself to give up resources like CPU time
 or the display. To give up the display a MIDlet should call the
 Display.setCurrent method with an null argument. To give up CPU time the
 MIDlet only has to end or block the threads it started. Another option is for
 the MIDlet to ask the system to start it in the future using the Alarm API.
 See the Push API in the MIDP Specification for information.</li>
<li>MIDlets that use a Canvas object suspend and resume threads it created
 based on the Canvas or CustomItem class's hideNotify and showNotify methods.
 They must not depend on startApp and pauseApp because the hideNotify and
 showNotify methods also get called when a MIDlet is paused and activated.</li>
</ul>
<p>MIDlet can be paused if desired by a device manufacture by using the
 MIDletProxy class or the native application manager API. The common reasons
 for customizing a system to pause MIDlets are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The system allows the user to launch more than one MIDlet but only has
 the resources to run one MIDlet. In this case, the system pauses the MIDlets
 that do not have the physical display until the current MIDlet gives up the
 display.</li>
<li>The OS is about to suspend the CPU time for the VM process (as opposed to
 ending the process). In this case, the system pauses all of the MIDlets and
 activates them again when the OS resumes CPU time for the VM process.</li>
</ul>
