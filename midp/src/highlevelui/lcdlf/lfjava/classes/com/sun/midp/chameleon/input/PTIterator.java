/**
 *  Aniterator that provides predictive text browsing capabilities
 *  Requires only single word predictive text librray support.
 *  Traversal is done by using nextLevel(keyCode) to enter keys and
 *  next() to get possible completions.
 *
 *  Exmaple of using predictive text iterators:
 *
 *      PTDictionary dictionary;
 *      Iterator iter=dictionary.iterator();
 *      iter.nextLevel('2');
 *      iter.nextLevel('2');
 *      iter.nextLevel('2');
 *      while(iter.hasNext()) {
 *          String completion=iter.next();
 *          System.out.println(completion);
 *          //will print "aca" (short of "academy") "cab" (short of "cabin"),
 *          // "acc" (short of "accelerate") etc.
 *      }
 *
 * PTIterator operations:
 *          next()              : get next possible completion string
 *          hasNext()           : check if another possible completion exists
 *          nextLevel(int key)  : add a char to the current completion
 *          prevLevel()         : backspace last char from current completion
 *          reset()             : clear current completion
 *          resetNext()         : revert to first possible completion string
