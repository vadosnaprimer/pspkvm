/**
 * <code>VolumeControl</code> is an interface for manipulating 
 * the audio volume of a <code>Player</code>.
 *
 * <h3>Volume Settings</h3>
 * This interface allows the output volume to be specified 
 * using an integer value that varies between 0 and 100.
 *
 *<h4>Specifying Volume in the Level Scale</h4>
 * The level scale specifies volume in a linear scale.
 * It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents
 * silence and 100 represents the highest volume.
 * The mapping for
 * producing a linear multiplicative value is
 * implementation dependent.
 * <p>
 *
 * <h3>Mute</h3>
 * Setting mute on or off doesn't change the volume level
 * returned by getLevel.
 * If mute is <CODE>true</CODE>,
 * no audio signal is produced by this <code>Player</code>; if mute 
 * is <CODE>false</CODE>
 * an audio signal is produced and the volume is restored.
 *
 * <h3>Volume Change Events</h3>
 * When the state of the <code>VolumeControl</code> changes, a
 * <code>VOLUME_CHANGED</code> event is delivered through
 * the <code>PlayerListener</code>.
 *
 * @see javax.microedition.media.Control
 * @see javax.microedition.media.Player
