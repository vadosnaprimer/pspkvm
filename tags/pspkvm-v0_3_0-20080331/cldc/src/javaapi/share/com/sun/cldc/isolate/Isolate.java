 * The <code>Isolate</code> class provides the means of creating and managing
 * isolated computations and arranging for their communication with each
 * other.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Terminology</h3>
 *
 * Each isolated computation is called a <b>Task</b>. An <b>Isolate
 * object</b> is a Java representation of the task. Multiple
 * Isolate objects may be created to represent the same task. Where
 * the context is clear, the words "task", "isolate" and "isolate
 * object" may be used interchangeably. When a distinction needs to be
 * made, the word "task" is used to describe the underlying
 * computation, and the word "isolate" is used to describe the Java
 * object(s) that represent the computation. <p>
 *
 * When two Isolate objects represent the same task, they are said to
 * be <b>equivalent</b> to each other. Equivalent Isolate objects are
 * created to avoid the sharing of Isolate objects across task
 * boundaries. For example, in the following program, task A launches
 * task B using the object <code>b1</code>, and task B gets a
 * reference to itself using the object
 * <code>b2</code>. <code>b1</code> and <code>b2</code> are two
 * distinct objects: <p>
 *
 *<blockquote><pre>
 *class TaskA {
 *    void launchB() {
 *        Isolate <b>b1</b> = new Isolate("TaskB", ....);
 *        b1.start();
 *    }
 *}
 *class TaskB {
 *    public static void main(String args[]) {
 *        Isolate <b>b2</b> = Isolate.currentIsolate();
 *    }
 *}</pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h3>Degree of Isolation</h3>
 *
 * Tasks in the CLDC environment are isolated in the following sense:
 * <ul>
 *     <li> Each task has a separate namespace for loading Java classes.
 *     <li> Each task has a separate set of static variables for Java classes
 *     <li> A <code>synchronized static</code> method uses a different 
 *          monitor object inside each task.
 *     <li> Typically no Java objects are shared across task boundaries.
 *          (see <a href=#classdoc_sharing>Object Sharing</a> below for
 *          exceptions).
 *     <li> Resource quotas are controlled by the runtime environment to
 *          prevent tasks to use excessive amount of resources. The
 *          implementation currently supports resource control for 
 *          memory or CPU cycles.
 * </ul>         
 *
 * <a name="classdoc_class_path"><h3>Class path</h3></a>
 *
 * <p>Part of the definition of an isolate is its
 * classpath, where the basic classes for the isolate are found.
 * The CLDC runtime searches for classes in three sets of
 * locations: 
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The romized system classes.
 *     <li>The isolate system class path.
 *     <li>The isolate application class path.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><i>System</i> and <i>application</i> class paths are specified separately
 * for an isolate when it is created. Classes on system and application class
 * paths have different access rights: 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Only classes loaded from the system class path can access 
 *       hidden classes.
 *   <li>Only classes on the system class path can be loaded to restricted
 *       packages.
 * </ul>
 * For the definition of hidden and restricted packages, see
 * doc/misc/Romizer.html.
 *
 * <p>When an isolate requests a class, the class is first looked up the
 * romized system classes, then searched in the isolate system class path,
 * and then searched in the isolate application class path.
 *
 * <p>User application classes should be put on the application class path,
 * system class path can contain only trusted system classes.
 *
 * <p>WARNING: UNTRUSTED USER APPLICATION CLASSES MUST NEVER BE PUT ON THE
 * SYSTEM CLASS PATH, AS IT GRANTS THEM ACCESS TO SYSTEM INTERNALS AND BREAKS
 * SYSTEM SECURITY.
 *
 * <a name="classdoc_sharing"><h3>Object Sharing</h3></a>
 *
 * The Isolate API in CLDC does not support the sharing of arbitrary
 * Java object across Isolate boundaries. The only exception is String
 * objects: String objects may be passed as arguments from a parent
 * isolate to a child isolate's <code>main()</code> method. Such
 * Strings are passed by reference instead of by value in order to
 * conserve resource. Also, interned Strings (such as literal Strings
 * that appear inside Java source code) may be shared across Isolate
 * boundaries. <p>
 *
 * Even though String objects may be shared across isolates, different
 * isolates should not attempt to coordinate their activities by
 * synchronizing on these Strings. Specifically, an interned Strings cannot
 * be synchronized across isolate boundaries because it uses a different
 * monitor object in each Isolate. <p>
 *
 * <h3>Inter-Isolate Communication</h3>
 *
 * Isolates may need to communicate with each to coordinate their
 * activities. The recommended method of inter-isolate communication 
 * is a <b>native event queue</b>. On many CLDC/MIDP environments a native 
 * event queue already exists. Such event queues can be extended for
 * one isolate to send events to another isolate. <p>
 *
 * Some CLDC/MIDP implementors may be tempted to use native code to
 * pass shared objects from one isolate to another, and use
 * traditional Java object-level synchronization to perform
 * inter-isolate communication. In our experience this could easily
 * lead to inter-isolate deadlock that could be exploited by
 * downloaded malicious Midlets. For example, if a shared object is
 * used to synchronize screen painting, a malicious Midlet may stop
 * other Midlets from painting by not returning from its
 * <code>paint()</code> method. <p>
 *
 * In our experience, with shared objects, it would take significant
 * effort to design a system that can prevent such attacks. In
 * contrast, event queues are much more easily understood to design
 * a safe environment. Thus, we strongly recommend against using
 * shared objects for inter-isolate communication.<p>
 * 
 * The following code is an example of how an isolate can create other
 * isolates:
 *
 *<blockquote><pre>import com.sun.cldc.isolate.*;
 *
 *class HelloWorld {
 * 
 *    // Usage: cldc_vm -classpath <XX> HelloWorld HelloWorld2 <classpath>
 *    public static void main(String [] argv) {
 *        System.out.println("HelloWorld");
 *        for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
 *            try {
 *                // pass i as an argument to the isolate just for fun 
 *               String[] isoArgs = {Integer.toString(i)};
 *                Isolate iso = new Isolate(argv[0], isoArgs);
 *                iso.start();
 *             } catch (Exception e) {
 *                System.out.println("caught exception " + e);
 *                e.printStackTrace();
 *            }
 *            System.out.println("HelloWorld: Iso " + i + " started.");
 *
 *        }
 *    }
 *}
 *
 *
 *class HelloWorld2 {
 *    static String st = "HelloWorld2[";
 *
 *    public static void main(String [] argv) {
 *        st = st.concat(argv[0]);
 *        st = st.concat("]");
 *        System.out.println("st is " + st);
 *        System.exit(42);
 *    }
 *} </pre></blockquote>
