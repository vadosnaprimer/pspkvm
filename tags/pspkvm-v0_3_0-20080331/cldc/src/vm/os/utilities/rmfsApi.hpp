/**
 * Functions and data structures that make up the Raw Memory File System 
 * interface. The RMFS  external interfaces hides any directory hierarchies by
 * making the file system look like a flat file system.
 *
 * <p>More specifically, for filenames, the storage implementation must
 * support 255 character long, 8-bit character, file names. Legal characters
 * are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, %, and #.  The filenames will differ in more than
 * just case, so case-insensitive systems like Win32 are not a problem.
