/**
 * <code>MIDIControl</code> provides access to MIDI rendering
 * and transmitting devices.<p>
 *
 * Typical devices that are controlled with <code>MIDIControl</code>
 * are internal synthesizers (software/hardware) or external
 * hardware ports. Devices are virtual, i.e. even if there is only
 * one physical synthesizer, all instances of <code>MIDIControl</code> seem
 * to operate on its own synthesizer.<p>
 *
 * General functionality of this control is:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>Querying current state of the device:
 *  <ul>
 *   <li>The programs that are currently assigned to each of the 16 channels</li>
 *   <li>Volume of each channel</li>
 *  </ul></li>
 *  <li>Querying the banks of the synthesizer:
 *  <ul>
 *   <li>Get a list of internal sound banks</li>
 *   <li>Get a list of custom sound banks</li>
 *   <li>Get the list of programs of a sound bank</li>
 *   <li>Get the name of a specific program</li>
 *  </ul></li>
 *  <li>Set the volume assigned to a channel</li>
 *  <li>Set the bank/program assigned to a channel</li>
 *  <li>Send short MIDI messages to the device</li>
 *  <li>Send long MIDI messages (system exclusive)</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * In Java Sound terms, <code>MIDIControl</code> combines
 * methods and concepts of the interfaces Transmitter,
 * Receiver, Synthesizer, MidiChannel, Soundbank, and Patch.<p>
 *
 * In this context, the following naming conventions are used:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>A <i>program</i> refers to a single instrument. This is
 *  also known as a patch.</li>
 *  <li>A <i>bank</i> is short for sound bank. It contains up
 *  to 128 programs, numbered in the range from 0..127.</li>
 *  <li>An <i>internal bank</i> is provided by the software
 *  implementation or the hardware of the device.</li>
 *  <li>A <i>custom bank</i> is installed by an application,
 *  e.g. by loading an XMF meta file with an embedded bank.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The conception of <code>MIDIControl</code> is based on scope and
 * abstraction level:
 * <ul>
 *  <li><code>MIDIControl</code> has methods that are specific
 *  to the device or renderer, and do not directly relate to a specific
 *  MIDI file or sequence to be played. However, as devices are virtual,
 *  MIDIControl's methods only operate on this virtual device.
 *  On the other hand, it is also
 *  possible to get an instance of <code>MIDIControl</code>
 *  without providing a sequence or MIDI file; this is done by
 *  specifying a magic Locator:<br>
 *  <br><code>
 *  &nbsp;&nbsp;try{
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Player
 *    p = Manager.createPlayer(Manager.MIDI_DEVICE_LOCATOR);
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MIDIControl
 *    synth = (MIDIControl)p.getControls("javax.microedition.media.control.MIDIControl");
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;} catch (MediaException e) {
 *  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;}
 *  </code></li>
 *
 *  <li><code>MIDIControl</code>'s methods can be considered
 *  advanced, low level functionality. This has 2 implications:
 *  <ol>
 *   <li><code>MIDIControl</code> is optional, i.e. no Player
 *   instance is required to provide an implementation of
 *   it</li>
 *   <li>Basic media or MIDI player applications will not need
 *   <code>MIDIControl</code>; {@link VolumeControl VolumeControl},
 *   {@link TempoControl TempoControl}, and {@link PitchControl PitchControl}
 *   are sufficient for basic needs.
 *   </li>
 *  </ol></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A useful function is &quot;Panic&quot;: immediately turn off all
 * sounds and notes. It can be implemented using the following code fragment:<br>
 * <code>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;int CONTROL_ALL_SOUND_OFF = 0x78;<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;for (int channel = 0; channel < 16; channel++) {<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shortMidiEvent(CONTROL_CHANGE | channel, CONTROL_ALL_SOUND_OFF, 0);<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * The implementation need not support the various query methods.
 * This is a technical limitation, as the MIDI standard does not
 * provide a standardized means to query the current program or 
 * the installed
 * soundbanks. This especially applies to external MIDI ports.
 * Optional methods must not be called if {@link #isBankQuerySupported isBankQuerySupported}
 * returns false.
