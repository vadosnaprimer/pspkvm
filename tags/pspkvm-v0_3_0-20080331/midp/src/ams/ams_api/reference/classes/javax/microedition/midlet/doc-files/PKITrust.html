    <H1>Trusted MIDlet Suites using X.509 PKI</H1>
    <P>Signed MIDlet suites may become trusted by authenticating the
      signer of the MIDlet suite and binding it to a protection domain
      that will authorize the MIDlet suite to perform protected
      functions by granting permissions allowed in the protection
      domain.  The mechanisms defined here allow signing and
      authentication of MIDlet suites based on X.509 Public Key
      Infrastructure so the device can verify the signer and trust the
      MIDlet suite. </P>

    <P>If an implementation of this specification will recognize
      MIDlet suites signed using PKI as trusted MIDlet suites they
      MUST be signed and verified according to the formats and
      processes below.</P>

    <P>The MIDlet suite is protected by signing the JAR.
      The signature and certificates are added to the application
      descriptor as attributes.  The device uses them to verify the
      signature. The device completes the authentication using a
      root certificate bound to a protection domain on the
      device. The details of the processes and formats follow.<P>

    <H3>References</H3>
    <P>MIDP devices are expected to operate using standard Internet
      and wireless protocols and techniques for transport and security. The
      current mechanisms for securing Internet content is based
      on existing Internet standards for public key cryptography:</P>

    <H3><A NAME=sign> Signing a MIDlet Suite</A></H3>
    <P>The security model involves the MIDlet suite, a signer, 
      and public key certificates.
      As with any public key system authentication is
      based on a set of root certificates which are used
      to verify other certificates.
      
      Zero or more root certificates will need to be on the device.
      Additionally, root certificates may be present in removable
      media such as SIM(WIM) card/USIM module.
      Implementations MUST support X.509 Certificates and
      corresponding algorithms.
      Devices MAY support additional signing mechanisms
      and certificate formats.</P>
    <P>The signer of the MIDlet suite may be the developer or some entity
      that is responsible for distributing, supporting, and perhaps billing
      for its use. The signer will need to have a public key
      certificate that can be validated to one of
      the protection domain root certificates on the device. The
      public key is used to verify the signature on the MIDlet suite. The
      public key is provided as a RSA X.509
      certificate included in the application descriptor.</P>


    <P>Attributes defined within the manifest of the JAR are protected
      by the signature.  Attributes defined within the application
      descriptor are not secured.  When an attribute appears in the
      manifest it <EM>MUST NOT</EM> be overridden by a different value
      from the application descriptor. For trusted MIDlet suites the
      value in the application descriptor must be equal to the value of
      the corresponding attribute in the manifest.  If not, the MIDlet
      suite MUST NOT be installed. The
      <CODE>MIDlet.getAppProperty</CODE> method must return the
      attribute value from the manifest if one is defined.  If not,
      the value from the application descriptor (if any) is returned.</P>
    <P>
      Note that the requirement that attributes values be equal
      differs from MIDP 1.0 and must be used for applications that are
      signed and verified by these procedures. For untrusted
      application descriptors, the MIDP 1.0 rule giving priority to
      application descriptor attributes over manifest attributes must
      be followed. </P>

    <H3>Caching of Authentication and Authorization Results</H3>
    <P>
      The implementation of the authentication and authorization
      process may store and transfer the results for subsequent use
      and MUST ensure that the cached information practically can not
      be tampered with or otherwise compromised between the
      time it is computed from the JAR, application descriptor, and
      authentication information and the authorization information is
      used.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      It is essential that the MIDlet suite and security
      information used to authenticate and authorize a MIDlet suite
      is not compromised, for example, by use of removable media or
      other access to MIDlet suite storage that might be corrupted.
    </P>


    <H3>Security in Split-VM Implementations</H3>
    <P>
      In environments that make use of a split VM (CLDC 5.4.6), it is
      possible to implement the security mechanism using JARs but this
      relies on converting the JAR to the device format when the JAR
      enters the network while faithfully preserving the semantics of
      the MIDlet.  Once the conversion has happened, the device format
      of the application must be secured against tampering and retain
      its authorized permissions.  This network security is often based
      on similar digital signature techniques to MIDlet security and
      it may be the case that this network security infrastructure is
      already present and active. If and only if this kind of network
      security infrastructure already exists and it can support all
      forms of protection required by this specification (and any
      future JSRs based on this specification), a permissible
      implementation of MIDlet Suite Security can be based on
      authenticating and authorizing the device format of the MIDlet
      since these implementation formats are the actual executable
      content that will be used on the device.  The details of
      authenticating and authorizing a device format version of a
      MIDlet suite are implementation specific and thus not covered by
      this specification.
    </P>

    <H2><A NAME=profile>MIDP X.509 Certificate Profile for Trusted
	  MIDlet Suites</A></H2>

    <P>Secured trusted MIDlet suites utilize the same base
      certificate profile as does HTTPS.  The profile is based on the
      WAP Certificate Profile, WAP-211-WAPCert-20010522-a [WAPCert]
      which is based on RFC2459 Internet X.509 Public Key
      Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile [RFC2459].  Refer to
      the package documentation for
      <CODE>javax.microedition.pki</CODE> for details.</P>

    <H3>Certificate Processing for OTA</H3>
    <P>Devices MUST recognize the key usage extension and when present
      verify that the extension has the <CODE>digitalSignature</CODE> bit set. 
      Devices MUST recognize the critical extended key usage extension
      and when present verify that the extension contains the
      <CODE>id-kp-codeSigning</CODE> object identifier (see RFC2459
      sec. 4.2.1.13).</P>

    <P>The application descriptor SHOULD NOT include a self-issued 
      root certificate in a descriptor certificate chain. However MIDP
      devices SHOULD treat the certificate as any other in a chain and
      NOT explicitly reject a chain with a X.509v3 self-issued CA
      certificate in its chain.</P>

    <H3><A NAME=revocation>Certificate Expiration and Revocation</A></H3>
    <P>Expiration and revocation of certificates
      supplied in the application descriptor is checked during the
      authorization procedure, specifically during certificate path
      validation. Certificate expiration is checked locally on the
      device as such information is retrievable from the certificate
      itself. Certificate expiration verification is an intrinsic and
      mandatory part of certificate path validation.</P>

    <P>Certificate revocation is a more complex check as it
      requires sending a request to a server and the decision is made
      based on the received response. Certificate revocation can be
      performed if the appropriate mechanism is implemented on the
      device. Such mechanisms are not part of MIDP implementation and
      hence do not form a part of MIDP security framework.</P>

    <P>If certificate revocation is implemented in the device, it SHOULD
      support Online Certificate Status protocol (OCSP)
      [RFC2560]. If other certificate revocation protocols are
      supported, support for these other protocols may indicate that a
      certificate has been revoked; in this case, it is permissible to
      consider the certificate as revoked regardless of the result
      returned by the OCSP protocol.</P>

    <H3>Examples of MIDlet Suite Signing</H3>
    <P>There are many ways to structure protection domain root
      certificates and their associated signing policies.  These
      examples are provided to illustrate some of the concepts in this
      specification and are not meant to limit the ways MIDlet PKI
      signing can be used.  The examples allow MIDlets to be
      revoked (provided the device supports certificate revocation)
      but at differing granularities.</P>


    <H4>Example 1 - Developer Owns Signing Certificate</H4>

    <P>This encodes the origin of the MIDlet suite into the JAD (via
      the identity of the signer). If the certificate is revoked,
      all of the developer's signed MIDlets on every device for every
      user will have their execution permissions revoked.</P>
