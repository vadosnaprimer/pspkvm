 The RecordStoreFile class provides a file interface to persistent
 storage for MIDlet suite records via the RecordStore API.  Implements
 a unified random access file interface to storage utilizing the
 capabilities of the File and RandomAccessStream classes provided by
 the internal com.sun.midp.io.j2me.storage package.
<p>
 An important capability of this class is to confine the scope of the
 storage name space visible to a MIDlet to be files created by
 applications in its MIDlet suite.  This occurs because all
 RecordStore calls that access storage do so through RecordStoreFile,
 which converts maps the RecordStore's name into a unique identifier
 in storage, prefixed by a prefix unique to its MIDlet suite.  Any
 call which modifies storage (e.g. deleteRecordStore) is confined in
 scope to storage allocated by a MIDlet or another MIDlet in the same
 suite.
