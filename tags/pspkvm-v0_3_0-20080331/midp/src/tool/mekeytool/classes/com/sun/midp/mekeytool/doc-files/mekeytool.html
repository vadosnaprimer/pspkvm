<h2>ME Key Tool</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

Provides a command line interface to manage mobile equipment (ME) keystore
for the MIDP implementation.
<p>
The ME Key Tool uses the Java<sup>tm</sup> Standard Edition
(J2SE) keystore API to access J2SE keystores. J2SE provides the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html">
command line tool</a> to manage J2SE keystores.</p>

The general usage for the ME Key Tool is (from the MIDP home directory):
<blockquote>
  <code>java -jar bin/MEKeyTool.jar</code> <i>(command followed by  arguments for the command)</i>
</blockquote>

The ME Key Tool provides the following commands.
<ul>
  <li>Display usage help text</li>
  <li>Import a public key into an ME keystore from a J2SE keystore</li>
  <li>Delete a key from an ME keystore</li>
  <li>List the keys in an ME keystore</li>
</ul>
For shell script use, when a command is successful, the status code upon
completion will be "0" and if there is an error it will be "-1".

<h3>General Argument Parsing Considerations</h3>

Properly producing user friendly command line argument errors requires a
great deal of code, and since this tool is not intended for the general
public, this tool with have very simple option
parsing that will lead to to some less then user friendly error conditions.
Like the J2SE "java" command, any potentially valid value for an option will be
accepted for that option even if it looks like a option flag. No positive
case will be disallowed to make the errors more user friendly. Basically the
tool will make only ensure that option values are formated according to the
specification of the underlying Java APIs.

<h3>Display Usage Help Text</h3>

The command to display help text is "-help". There are no arguments for the
command. The usage text is also displayed when JAD Tool arguments are 
not in the correct format or missing. The usage text is:
<blockquote><pre>
MEKeyTool argument combinations:

  -help
  -import [-MEkeystore &lt;filename&gt;] [-keystore &lt;filename&gt;]
          [-storepass &lt;password&gt;] -alias &lt;key alias&gt; [-domain &lt;domain&gt;]
  -list [-MEkeystore &lt;filename&gt;]
  -delete [-MEkeystore &lt;filename&gt;]
          (-owner &lt;owner name&gt; | -number &lt;key number&gt;)

The default for -MEkeystore is "appdb/_main.ks".
The default for -keystore is $HOME/.keystore.
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Importing a Public Key</h3>

The ME Key Tool only imports keys contained in X.509 certificates.
<p>
The command for importing a public key into an ME keystore from a J2SE keystore
is "-import". The command has the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"-alias" followed by the alias of the certificate of the public key in the
    J2SE keystore, this is required to find the certificate in the
    keystore.</li>
  <li>"-keystore" followed by the filename of a J2SE keystore from
    which the get certificate. If not provided, the tool will assume
    the filename of the keystore is $HOME/.keystore.
    This is consistent with J2SE keytool.</li>
  <li>"-storepass" followed by a password to unlock the keystore if
    needed.</li>
  <li>"-MEkeystore" followed by the filename of a ME keystore to import the
    public key into. If not provided, the tool will assume
    "appdb/_main.ks".</li>
  <li>"domain" the security domain to associate with the public key. If
    not given "untrusted" will be used.</li>
</ul>

The following steps are performed when importing a public key into an
ME keystore.
<ol>
  <li>Load the ME keystore.</li>
  <li>Get the certificate from the J2SE keystore.</li>
  <li>Check to see if there are any keys owned by subject of the certificate
    in the ME keystore. If there are any keys found, exit if any of the keys
    found are a duplicate of the key in the certificate.</li>
  <li>Create an ME key object with the subject name, validity, and key
    from the certificate, plus the given security domain.</li>
  <li>Add the ME key object to the loaded keystore.</li>
  <li>Save the loaded keystore.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Listing Public Keys</h3>

The command for listing the keys in an ME keystore "-list". The command has
the following arguments:
<ul>
  <li>"-MEkeystore" followed by the filename of the ME keystore containing
  the keys to list. If not provided, the tool will assume
  "appdb/_main.ks".</li>
</ul>

Example of key listing:
<blockquote><pre>
Key 1
  Owner: C=US;O=RSA Data Security, Inc.;OU=Secure Server Certification Authority
  Valid from Tue Nov 08 19:00:00 EST 1994 to Thu Jan 07 18:59:59 EST 2010
  Security Domain: untrusted
Key 2
  Owner: CN=Sun Microsystems Inc TEST CA;O=Sun Microsystems Inc
  Valid from Mon Nov 20 16:20:50 EST 2000 to Fri Nov 20 16:20:50 EST 2009
  Security Domain: trusted
</pre></blockquote>

The following steps are performed when listing the key in an ME keystore.
<ol>
  <li>Load the ME keystore.</li>
  <li>For each key, print:
    <ul>
      <li>Number of the key (1 for the first)</li>
      <li>Name of the owner</li>
      <li>Validity</li>
      <li>Security domain</li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Deleting a Public Key</h3>

The command for deleting a key from an ME keystore "-delete". The command has
the following arguments:
<ul>
  <li>"-MEkeystore" followed by the filename of the ME keystore to delete a
    public key from. If not provided, the tool will assume
    "appdb/_main.ks".</li>
  <li>"-owner" followed by the common name of the key's owner as presented
    by the "-list" command. If not given the -number argument must be given.
    If "-owner" is given "-number" must not be given.</li>
  <li>"-number" followed by the number the key as presented
    by the "-list" command. If not given the -owner argument must be given.
    If "-number" is given "-owner" must not be given.</li>
</ul>

The following steps are performed when deleting a key from an ME keystore.
<ol>
  <li>Load the ME keystore.</li>
  <li>If the key selected by owner, delete the first key of the owner from
    the loaded keystore.</li>
  <li>If the key selected by number (1 for the first), delete 
    selected key from the loaded keystore.</li>
  <li>Save the loaded keystore.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Error Conditions</h3>

Not all error messages are created by the ME keytool code, the
tool relies on the java.security and java.io classes to generate messages.
So only when an error condition has a message created by the MIDP implementation code,
will the full message be specified. This is because the message not
under control of the MIDP implementation can change at anytime and this cannot be
considered a bug.
