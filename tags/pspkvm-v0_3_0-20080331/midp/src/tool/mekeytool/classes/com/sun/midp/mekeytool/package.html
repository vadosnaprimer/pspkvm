 Provides a <a href="MEKeyTool.html">Java<sup>tm</sup> API</a> and a
 <a href="doc-files/mekeytool.html">command line interface</a> (ME Key Tool)
 to manage the public keys in the mobile equipment keystore.</p>
<p>
 The key tool imports keys from Java<sup>tm</sup> Standard Edition keystores
 (J2SE).
 A J2SE<sup>tm</sup> keystore "jse_test_keystore.bin" is provided, it has the
 public key of the most popular Internet certificate authority for test
 purposes. Its password is "password". For example to see what is in the
 keystore, use the J2SE<sup>tm</sup>
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html">
 keytool</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 <code>keytool -list -keystore j2se_test_keystore.bin -storepass password
 </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For usage information on the MEKeyTool see:&nbsp;
<a href="MEKeyTool.html#main(java.lang.String[])">
<code>MEKeyTool.main()</code></a></p>
<h2>HTTPS and Certificates</h2>
<p>If you are using the HTTPS prototype API, you may have to install the public
 key of a certificate authority (CA) into the mobile equipment public
 keystore. MIDP includes the public key needed to verify VeriSign E-Commerce
 certificates. However, to verify other certificates from VeriSign (such as
 their trial certificates) and certificates from other CA's, their public keys
 must be manually installed into the public keystore. To do so, follow these
 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
 Import the certificate of the CA that issued the certificate you want verify
 into a Java<sup>tm</sup> 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) keystore using
 the J2SE<sup>tm</sup> keytool command. Assign the certificate an appropriate
 alias. (For testing without a CA, using a self signed server certificate,
 just use the server's certificate as a CA certificate.) For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 <code>keytool -import -keystore keystore -storepass password
 -file ca_cert.txt -alias httpsca</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
 Import the public key of the CA from the J2SE<sup>tm</sup> keystore into the
 MIDP public keystore by using the MEKeyTool. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 <code>java -jar bin/MEKeyTool.jar -import -keystore keystore
 -alias httpsca -storepass password</code></p>
<p>
 For usage information on the MEKeyTool, use the -help option.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>
 (optional) Check the result by listing the keys in the public
 keystore. For example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 <code>java -jar bin/MEKeyTool.jar -list</code></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>
