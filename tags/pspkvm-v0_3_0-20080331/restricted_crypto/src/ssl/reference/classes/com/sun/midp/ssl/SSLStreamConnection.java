/**
 * The SSLStreamConnection class implements the StreamConnection
 * interface. Data exchanged through a SSLStreamConnection is 
 * automatically protected by SSL. Currently, only SSL version 3.0
 * is supported and the list of cipher suites proposed 
 * by the client is hardcoded to {SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5,
 * SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5}. This version of the implementation 
 * does not support client authentication at the SSL layer -- a feature
 * that is rarely used.
 * 
 * Typical usage of this class by an application would be along the
 * following lines: <BR />
 * 
 * <PRE>
 *      // create a TCP connection
 *      StreamConnection t = Connector.open("socket://www.server.com:443");
 *
 *      // Create an SSL connection
 *      SSLStreamConnection s = new SSLStreamConnection("www.server.com", 443,
 *                 t.openInputStream(), t.openOutputStream());
 *      t.close();
 * 
 *      // obtain the associated input/output streams
 *      OutputStream sout = s.openOutputStream();
 *      InputStream sin = s.openInputStream();
 *      ...
 *      // send SSL-protected data by writing to sout and
 *      // receive SSL-protected by reading from sin
 *      ...
 *      sin.close();
 *      sout.close();
 *      s.close();   // close the SSL connection when done
 *
 * </PRE>
