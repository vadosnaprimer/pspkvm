<h1>ANILib -- Asynchronous Native Interface Library</h1>

<blockquote>

    ANILib, the Asynchronous Native Interface Library, is an add-on
    package for this Virtual Machine. It provides
    an API for using native threads in this VM for executing
    long running native methods. <p>

    ANILib was previously included as an bundled component of this VM.
    In this release, we have separated out the ANILib
    functionality into a separate package to improve maintainability
    and achieve a more modular software design.

</blockquote>

<h2>Version Information</h2>

<blockquote>

    This is version 1.0.1 of ANILib.

</blockquote>

<h2>Build Instructions</h2>

<blockquote>

    This version of ANILib has built-in support for 3 platforms: <p>

    <ul>
      <li> <code>win32_i386</code>
      <li> <code>linux_i386</code>
      <li> <code>linux_arm</code>
    </ul>
    <p>    

    The source code has been structured so that it will be easy to add
    support for other platforms. <p>

    To build ANILib for your selected platform, you need to follow
    these steps. (Note the instructions assumes you're building for
    <code>linux_i386</code>.) <p>

    <ol>
      <li> First, you need to build the VM. This can be done
           by setting up the <code>JVMWorkSpace</code> environment
           variable, and then executing the <code>gnumake</code>
           command inside
           <code>$(JVMWorkSpace)/build/linux_i386</code>. <p>

      <li> Change to the <code>build/linux_i386</code> subdirectory of 
           the ANILib source distribution, and execute the
           <code>gnumake</code> command. This produces the following
           output files: <p>
           
           <ul>
             <li> <code>build/linux_i386/product/cldc_vm_ani</code>
             <li> <code>build/linux_i386/product/libani.a</code>
             <li> <code>build/linux_i386/test_classes/SocketTest.class</code>
           </ul>

           <p>

      <li> By default, the <code>product</code> variant of ANILib is
           produced. If you wish to build for other variants, please use
           commands such as: <p>

           <ul>
             <li> <code>gnumake BUILD=debug</code>
             <li> <code>gnumake BUILD=release</code>
             <li> <code>gnumake BUILD=product</code>
           </ul>

<h2>Running Test Programs</h2>

<blockquote>

    ANILib comes with a sample program, <code>SocketTest</code>, which
    tests the capabilities of a sample socket protocol. To Execute it,
    try these commands:

    <blockquote><code>
    cd build/linux_i386<br>
    ./product/cldc_vm_ani -cp test_classes SocketTest -host www.sun.com
    </code></blockquote>

    Please read the comments in <a
    href="src/tests/SocketTest.java"><code>src/tests/SocketTest.java</code></a>
    for a complete list of options provided by SocketTest for testing
    different features in ANILib.

</blockquote>

<h2>Linking with ANILib</h2>

<blockquote>

    To use the <code>ANI_XXX()</code> functions exported by ANILib,
    simply link with <code>libani.a</code> (or <code>ani.lib</code>
    for the <code>win32_i386</code> platform). <p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Changes from Previous Version</h2>

<blockquote>

    This version of ANILib adds a new API function,
    <code>ANI_Initialize()</code>, which must be called before you use
    any other ANI functions. <p>

    Also, when your program is about exit, please call
    <code>ANI_Dispose()</code> to free up resources allocated by
    ANILib. <p>

    When compiling your code, please use the <a
    href="src/share/ani.h"><code>src/share/ani.h</code></a> header
    file included in this ANILib source distribution. <p>
