     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the <tt>equals(Object)</tt>
     *     method, then calling the <code>hashCode</code> method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
     *     method, then calling the <tt>hashCode</tt> method on each of the
     *     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
     *     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     *     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables.

     * <p>
     * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
