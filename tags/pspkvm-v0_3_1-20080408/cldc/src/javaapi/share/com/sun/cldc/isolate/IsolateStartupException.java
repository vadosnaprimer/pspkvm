/**
 * An exception thrown when the implementation is unable to start
 * execution of a new isolate due to an error or exceptional condition
 * in the bootstrap code for the new isolate (i.e., before the
 * application starts).  Generally, this exception implies the new
 * isolate was misconfigured, and the misconfiguration was detected
 * when the isolate was initializing (either during the {@linkplain
 * Isolate#Isolate constructor call} or {@link Isolate#start
 * Isolate.start invocation}).  If the underlying misconfiguration resulted in an
 * exception in the new isolate, the accessors for the remote exception
 * information will provide the details.  If not, those methods will
 * all return <code>null</code>.
 *
 * <p> Any errors or exceptions thrown by application code in the new
 * isolate will be handled by the default {@link
 * ThreadGroup#uncaughtException ThreadGroup.uncaughtException} and
 * will not manifest as an <code>IsolateStartupException</code> in the creating
 * isolate.
 *
 * <p>Because any nested exception occurred in a remote
 * isolate, the exception cannot be directly {@linkplain
 * java.lang.Throwable#initCause chained} (for example, the exception
 * type may be available in the creator).  However, the information
 * about the remote exception is available from the {@link
 * #getRemoteName}, {@link #getRemoteMessage} methods.
 *
 * <p>The detail message in an <code>IsolateStartupException</code> will
 * be the <code>toString</code> string of the original exception in the
 * remote isolate, if available.  The backtrace associated with an
 * <code>IsolateStartupException</code> will be from the current thread's
 * stack.
