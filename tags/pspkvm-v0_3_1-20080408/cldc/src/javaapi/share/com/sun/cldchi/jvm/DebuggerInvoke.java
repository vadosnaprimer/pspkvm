    /**
     * This method is used to synchronously invoke a method on 
     * behalf of a debugger and then return the method return value back
     * to the debugger.  The reason for this sync method is the
     * non-synchronous nature of EntryActivations in the VM.  Picture this,
     * some event happens in the VM, like a breakpoint, which gets sent to
     * the debugger.  The debugger decides to invoke a Method.  The return
     * packet to the debugger for that invoke can't be sent until the Method
     * returns and we send the return value (or exception object!) back to 
     * the debugger.  So, all threads are suspended in the VM, we have
     * a Method in hand and the debugger has picked a thread to execute this
     * Method.  We create an entry activation for that Method with all the
     * args passed in by debugger.  Then we create another entry activattion
     * for this method.  This allows us to synchronously call the Method
     * requested, catch any exceptions and then call back down into the VM
     * to send the reply packet.  The return code in the VM will strip off
     * these method calls from the thread stack so the thread will be back
     * in the state it was before we started this whole invoke thing.  We 
     * use two different return call methods based on what type of caller
     * was on the stack when we started the whole invoke process.  This is
     * because there are two entry points into the VM; shared_call_vm and
     * shared_call_vm_oop. (Don't care about shared_call_vm_exception). We
     * need to make sure that the original call into the VM returns properly
     * including any return values (object or otherwise) stored on the stack
     * or in the EntryFrame or ThreadDesc.
     *
     * @param entry really an EntryActivation object from the VM
     * 
     * @param transport a Transport object from the VM
     *
     * @param id debugger request id used to generate outgoing reply packet
     *
     * @param options invoke options from debugger
     *
     * @param return_type return type of Method being invoked
     *
     * @param is_obj_return if original caller of VM was shared_call_vm_oop
