 *
 * File System APIs define the standatd POSIX file system functionality. 
 * This functionality includes reading and writing from files and 
 * accessing file's properties:
 * - Accesing file contents:
 *    - file open
 *    - file close
 *    - file read
 *    - file write
 *    - file seek
 * - Accessing file's properties
 *    - rename file
 *    - delete file
 *    - truncate file
 *    - sizeof file
 *    - file exist
 * 
 * 
 * <b>Unicode support.</b> Note that filenames defined in Java are coded in 
 * UNICODE support long file name Most devices requires conversion of UNICODE 
 * filenames to utf8, or wide char encoded representation with limited number 
 * of characters.
 * Both these gaps needs to be implemented by the platform. Note that utilities 
 * for this conversion can be supplied by Sun.
