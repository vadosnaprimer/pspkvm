/**
 * The GameCanvas class provides the basis for a game user interface.  In
 * addition to the features inherited from Canvas (commands, input events,
 * etc.) it also provides game-specific capabilities such as an
 * off-screen graphics buffer and the ability to query key status.
 * <p>
 * A dedicated buffer is created for each GameCanvas instance.  Since a
 * unique buffer is provided for each GameCanvas instance, it is preferable
 * to re-use a single GameCanvas instance in the interests of minimizing
 * heap usage.  The developer can assume that the contents of this buffer
 * are modified only by calls to the Graphics object(s) obtained from the
 * GameCanvas instance; the contents are not modified by external sources
 * such as other MIDlets or system-level notifications.  The buffer is
 * initially filled with white pixels.
 * <p>
 * The buffer's size is set to the maximum dimensions of the GameCanvas.
 * However, the area that may be flushed is limited by the current
 * dimensions of the GameCanvas (as influenced by the presence of a Ticker,
 * Commands, etc.) when the flush is requested.  The current dimensions of
 * the GameCanvas may be obtained by calling
 * {@link javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas#getWidth getWidth} and
 * {@link javax.microedition.lcdui.Canvas#getHeight getHeight}.
 * <p>
 * A game may provide its own thread to run the game loop.  A typical loop
 * will check for input, implement the game logic, and then render the updated
 * user interface. The following code illustrates the structure of a typical
 * game loop: <code>
 * <pre>
 * // Get the Graphics object for the off-screen buffer
 * Graphics g = getGraphics();
 *
 * while (true) {
 *      // Check user input and update positions if necessary
 *      int keyState = getKeyStates();
 *      if ((keyState & LEFT_PRESSED) != 0) {
 *          sprite.move(-1, 0);
 *      }
 *      else if ((keyState & RIGHT_PRESSED) != 0) {
 *          sprite.move(1, 0);
 *      }
 *
 *	// Clear the background to white
 *	g.setColor(0xFFFFFF);
 *	g.fillRect(0,0,getWidth(), getHeight());
 *
 *      // Draw the Sprite
 *      sprite.paint(g);
 *
 *      // Flush the off-screen buffer
 *      flushGraphics();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </code>
 * <P>

     * method, the regular key event mechanism can be suppressed for game keys

     * suppression of key events may improve performance by eliminating 
     * unnecessary system calls to keyPressed, keyRepeated and keyReleased

     * <p>
     * If requested, key event suppression for a given GameCanvas is started

     * ensures that the suppression effects only those key events intended for
     * the corresponding GameCanvas.  Thus, if key events are being generated
     * while another screen is still shown, those key events will continue to
     * be queued and dispatched until that screen is hidden and the GameCanvas
     * has replaced it.
     * <p>

     * release events instead.  Thus the state reported by getKeyStates might
