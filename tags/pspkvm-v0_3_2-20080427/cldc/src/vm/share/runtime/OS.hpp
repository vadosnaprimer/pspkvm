/** \class Os
 * OS.hpp: Operating system porting interface.
 *
 * Class "Os" defines the operating system (OS) porting
 * interface of the VM.  Each new OS port of
 * the system should provide an implementation of this
 * interface in the port-specific
 * "/src/vm/os/<os_name>/OS_<os_name>.cpp" file.
 *
 * Logically, the porting interface has been divided
 * into a number of subareas that must be supported
 * by each new OS port:
 *
 * (1) threading and thread synchronization operations
 * (3) miscellaneous OS-specific operations
 *
 * For more information on the OS porting interface,
 * refer to the Porting Guide.
