/**
 * An interface to a text input mode, such as alphanumeric, numeric, etc. 
 *
 * Before sending key input to any InputMode, it should be verified that
 * it supports the input constraints of the target text component. This is
 * done by verifying that the input constraints of the text component
 * (as defined in the MIDP specification for TextField) are supported by
 * this InputMode by calling its supportsConstraints() method.
 *
 * The display name of this InputMode is returned by the getName() method.
 * This value should be a locale appropriate value and suitable for 
 * displaying on the screen, such as an option on the device's system
 * menu.
 *
 * The remaining methods represent a simple state machine with the following
 * characteristics:
 *
 * To begin an input session, the first call MUST be beginInput(). This 
 * establishes an input session with this InputMode and allows the InputMode
 * to perform any session initialization needed. The parameter to beginInput()
 * is the InputModeMediator for the input session. The InputModeMediator is
 * a callback mechanism for the InputMode to automatically commit pending
 * input as well as end the input session.
 *   
 * Subsequent key input is passed to the InputMode via the processKey()
 * method. This method returns a String element. The returned String
 * represents the best possible input value based on the total key input 
 * during the input session. For example, for an AlphaNumeric InputMode, 
 * the pending input will only ever be a single String, representing
 * the character that corresponds to the last key entered. A 'null' return 
 * value from processKey() is an indication that this InputMode did not 
 * process the key at all, and it may need to be processed by other elements
 *  of the system. 
 * 
 * For a predictive
 * text InputMode such as T9, there could be several possible matches.
 * The return value from processKey() in this instance will be what the
 * system believes to be the best possible match. The return value of
 * the hasMoreMatches() method will indicate whether the InputMode has
 * more than one possible match to the given input. The matches can then
 * be retrieved using the getNextMatch() method. 
 *
 * Key processing should be considered complete after the call to the
 * InputMode's endInput() method. At this point, the InputMode should
 * consider the reference to the TextInputMediator passed to its
 * beginInput() method to be no longer valid. 
 *
 * The InputMode may itself at any time commit pending input by calling the
 * InputModeMediator's commitInput() method. The InputMode may also end
 * the input session by calling the inputModeCompleted() method. Calling
 * this method will result in a subsequent call to this InputMode's 
 * endInput() method.
 *
 * A typical call exchange with an InputMode could go as follows:
 *
 * InputMode im = ...;
 * im.beginInput(inputModeHandler);
 *
 * int res = im.processKey([key code for 4]);
 * if (pendingInput == null) {
 *     // The InputMode could not process the key code
 * } else {
 *     // Present the pendingInput value to the user as the
 *     // best possible match
 *     ...
 *     while (im.hasMoreMatches()) {
 *         pendingInput = im.getNextMatch();
 *         // Present the pendingInput value to the user as
 *         // the best possible match
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * im.endInput();
