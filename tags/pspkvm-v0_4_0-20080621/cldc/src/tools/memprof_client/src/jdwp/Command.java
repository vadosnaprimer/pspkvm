/**
 * This class encapsulates JDWP command. Its superclass
 * is <code>Packet</code> so it's based on <code>ByteBuffer</code>.
 * The class allows to set and get JDWP command number and automatically
 * assign command ID. The typical use of <code>Command</code> class is
 * as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Create a new command object with specified command number
 * <li> Fill command's data using standard <code>ByteBuffer</code>
 * and <code>Packet</code> methods (for example, <code>addInt()</code> or
 * <code>addReferenceTypeID()</code>)
 * <li> Execute command using <code>BackEndTest.checkReplyF()</code>,
 * <code>BackEndTest.sendCommand()</code> or
 * <code>BackEndTest.checkReply()</code>
 * <li> Work with received <code>Reply</code> object if needed
 * </ul>
