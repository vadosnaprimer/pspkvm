/**
 * A class representing a record store. A record store consists of a
 * collection of records which will remain persistent across multiple
 * invocations of the MIDlet. The platform is responsible for
 * making its best effort to maintain the integrity of the
 * MIDlet's record stores throughout the normal use of the
 * platform, including reboots, battery changes, etc.
 *
 * <p>Record stores are created in platform-dependent locations, which
 * are not exposed to the MIDlets. The naming space for record stores
 * is controlled at the MIDlet suite granularity. MIDlets within a
 * MIDlet suite are allowed to create multiple record stores, as long
 * as they are each given different names. When a MIDlet suite is
 * removed from a platform all the record stores associated with its
 * MIDlets will also be removed. MIDlets within a MIDlet suite can
 * access each other's record stores directly. New APIs in MIDP
 * allow for the explicit sharing of record stores if the MIDlet
 * creating the RecordStore chooses to give such permission.</p>
 *
 * <p> Sharing is accomplished through the ability to name a
 * RecordStore created by another MIDlet suite.</p>
 *
 * <P> RecordStores are uniquely named using the unique name of the
 * MIDlet suite plus the name of the RecordStore. MIDlet suites are
 * identified by the MIDlet-Vendor and MIDlet-Name attributes from the
 * application descriptor.</p>
 *
 * <p> Access controls are defined when RecordStores to be shared are
 * created. Access controls are enforced when RecordStores are
 * opened. The access modes allow private use or shareable
 * with any other MIDlet suite.</p>
 *
 * <p>Record store names are case sensitive and may consist of any
 * combination of between one and 32 Unicode characters
 * inclusive. Record store names must be unique within the scope of a
 * given MIDlet suite. In other words, MIDlets within a MIDlet suite
 * are not allowed to create more than one record store with the same
 * name, however a MIDlet in one MIDlet suite is allowed to have a
 * record store with the same name as a MIDlet in another MIDlet
 * suite. In that case, the record stores are still distinct and
 * separate.</p>
 *
 * <p>No locking operations are provided in this API. Record store
 * implementations ensure that all individual record store operations
 * are atomic, synchronous, and serialized, so no corruption will
 * occur with multiple accesses. However, if a MIDlet uses multiple
 * threads to access a record store, it is the MIDlet's responsibility
 * to coordinate this access or unintended consequences may result.
 * Similarly, if a platform performs transparent synchronization of a
 * record store, it is the platform's responsibility to enforce
 * exclusive access to the record store between the MIDlet and
 * synchronization engine.</p>
 *
 * <p>Records are uniquely identified within a given record store by
 * their recordId, which is an integer value. This recordId is used as
 * the primary key for the records. The first record created in a
 * record store will have recordId equal to one (1). Each subsequent
 * record added to a RecordStore will be assigned a recordId one
 * greater than the record added before it. That is, if two records
 * are added to a record store, and the first has a recordId of 'n',
 * the next will have a recordId of 'n + 1'. MIDlets can create other
 * sequences of the records in the RecordStore by using the
 * <code>RecordEnumeration</code> class.</p>
 *
 * <p>This record store uses long integers for time/date stamps, in
 * the format used by System.currentTimeMillis(). The record store is
 * time stamped with the last time it was modified. The record store
 * also maintains a <em>version</em> number, which is an integer that
 * is incremented for each operation that modifies the contents of the
 * RecordStore.  These are useful for synchronization engines as well
 * as other things.</p>
