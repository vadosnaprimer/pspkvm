/**
 * Starts a new process to handle the given URL. The new process executes
 * the value of the <tt>com.sun.midp.midlet.platformRequestCommand</tt>
 * system property. The URL is passed as this process' sole command-line
 * argument.
 *
 * If the platform has the appropriate capabilities and resources available,
 * it SHOULD bring the appropriate application to the foreground and let the
 * user interact with the content, while keeping the MIDlet suite running in
 * the background. If the platform does not have appropriate capabilities or
 * resources available, it MAY wait to handle the URL request until after the
 * MIDlet suite exits. In this case, when the requesting MIDlet suite exits,
 * the platform MUST then bring the appropriate application (if one exists) to
 * the foreground to let the user interact with the content.
 *
 * This is a non-blocking method. In addition, this method does NOT queue multiple
 * requests. On platforms where the MIDlet suite must exit before the request
 * is handled, the platform MUST handle only the last request made. On platforms
 * where the MIDlet suite and the request can be handled concurrently, each
 * request that the MIDlet suite makes MUST be passed to the platform software
 * for handling in a timely fashion.
 *
 * If the URL specified is of the form tel:<number>, as specified in RFC2806
 * (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2806.txt), then the platform MUST interpret this as
 * a request to initiate a voice call. The request MUST be passed to the phone
 * application to handle if one is present in the platform. The phone application,
 * if present, MUST be able to set up local and global phone calls and also perform
 * DTMF post dialing. Not all elements of RFC2806 need be implemented, especially
 * the area-specifier or any other requirement on the terminal to know its context.
 * The isdn-subaddress, service-provider and future-extension may also be ignored.
 * Pauses during dialing are not relevant in some telephony services. Devices MAY
 * choose to support additional URL schemes beyond the requirements listed above.
 *
 * @param pszUrl An ascii URL string
 *
 * @return <tt>JAVACALL_OK</tt> if the platform request is configured, and the MIDlet
 *                             suite MUST first exit before the content can be fetched.
 *         <tt>JAVACALL_FAIL</tt> if the platform request is configured, and the MIDlet
 *                             suite don't need to exit while the content can be fetched.
 *         <tt>JAVACALL_CONNECTION_NOT_FOUND</tt> if the platform request URL is not supported.
