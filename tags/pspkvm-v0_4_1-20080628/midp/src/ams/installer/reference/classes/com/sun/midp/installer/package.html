Contains classes that implement the Discovery Application, Over The Air (OTA)
 provisioning installer, and Autotester.

<p><h2>Discovery Application Example</h2>
</p>
<p>The Discovery Application component is an example of an application that
 finds MIDlet suites to download and install. The component is primarily a
 user interface, but also has some logic. It receives a URL from the user and
 displays a list of MIDlet suites at that URL. When the user selects a MIDlet
 suite, the component invokes the OTA Installer with the URL of the MIDlet
 suite.
</p>
<p>The Discovery Application example supports HTTP URLs, but does not support
 HTTPS URLs because there is no error handling for certificate exceptions.
 Because HTTPS connections are also HTTP connections, the Discovery
 Application accepts them and attempts to use them.
</p>
<p><h3>Detailed Design</h3>
</p>
<p>The Discovery Application example is implemented as a MIDlet called
 DiscoveryApp. It invokes the OTA Installer, which is a MIDlet called
 GraphicalInstaller. The Discovery Application is considered part of the
 internal MIDlet suite of ROMized applications. Java stack implementation
 grants the internal MIDlet suite the special permissions required to access
 classes restricted to externally installed suites. See "Classes Used by
 Internal MIDlets" in the porting guide for more information about the
 internal MIDlet suite's permissions.
<p>

</p>
<p>The DiscoveryApp MIDlet is included for testing and demonstration purposes
 only, and must be replaced by a more robust application on the production
 quality device. For example, if a browser is already on the device, it can be
 configured to invoke the GraphicalInstaller MIDlet when a downloaded resource
 has a MIME type that corresponds to a JAD or JAR file, instead of building a
 custom Discovery Application.
</p>
<p>The Discovery Application component reads HTML pages so that it can be
 replaced with standard web tools. So that the web pages that contain MIDlet
 suites can have other data and other links in addition to pointers to JAD and
 JAR files, the component only shows the links that end with .jad or .jar. All
 URLs must be absolute, and JAR file URLs must end with .jar.
</p>
<p><h2>Graphical Installer Example</h2>
</p>
<p>The Graphical Installer component is an example that interacts with the
 user to install MIDlet suites. It uses the HTTP protocol, in accordance with
 the MIDP Specification.
</p>
<p><h3>Detailed Design</h3>
</p>
<p>The Graphical Installer example consists of the GraphicalInstaller class
 and the SecureInstaller class. The GraphicalInstaller is considered part of
 the internal MIDlet suite of ROMized applications. Java stack implementation
 grants the internal MIDlet suite the special permissions required to
 access classes restricted to externally installed suites.
</p>
<p>The GraphicalInstaller accepts the following three arguments as application
 properties:
</p>
<ul>
<li>arg-0 &shy; Either "U" if the application is being updated by the application
 manager or "I" if the user selected the URL from a discovery application</li>
<li>arg-1 &shy; An HTTP or HTTPS URL to a JAD or JAR file</li>
<li>arg-2 &shy; An optional application name to display in the title bar instead
 of "Application"</li>
</ul>
<p>The GraphicalInstaller starts the SecureInstaller in its own thread. Then,
 based on callbacks from the SecureInstaller, it presents different forms
 (confirmation, password entry, or progress) to the user. It runs until the
 installer or the user ends the process.
</p>
<p>Diagram showing the graphical installer class</p>
<p>The SecureInstaller performs the functions common to all installers written
 in the Java programming language, including HTTP handling, application
 verification, and storage. See "Installer Services" below for information.
</p>
<p>After a successful installation, the Graphical Installer stores the new
 MIDlet suite's suiteID in a settings record store of the internal MIDlet
 suite. The diagram below shows the sequence of events that occur during a
 simple MIDlet download and installation.

<p><h2>Java Installer Services</h2>
</p>
<p>Installer services are provided for Java platform and C-based installers.
 For the Java platform, the SecureInstaller provides a framework that handles
 the non-user-interface parts of MIDlet suite installation. This consists of
 getting the MIDlet suite from an HTTP server into MIDlet suite storage as
 specified by the MIDP Specification, including the optional public key
 infrastructure (PKI) authentication for MIDlet suites. For C, MIDP Optimized 
 Implementation software 
 provides a collection of primitive installer functions, but
 no HTTP or PKI authentication support.
</p>
Contains classes that implement the Over The Air (OTA) provisioning installer.
<p><h3><code>SecureInstaller</code> Detailed Design</h3>
</p>
<p>The Installer class provides the following functionality:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Bypass JAD processing for JAR only suites</li>
<li>Stores and updates MIDlet suites in MIDlet suite storage</li>
<li>Determines the initial permissions of a MIDlet suite (when updating, the
 previous user-level permissions are kept if they apply to the new suite)</li>
<li>Notifies the servers listed in the MIDlet-Notify attribute of the
 installation's success or failure</li>
<li>Posts any pending deletion notifications</li>
<li>Registers static push connections</li>
<li>Rejects incoming push notifications while installing a MIDlet suite</li>
<li>Handles the following aspects of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols:
  <ul>
  <li>HTTP retries, but waits no more than 60 seconds</li>
  <li>HTTP authentication fields</li>
  <li>HTTP proxy-authentication fields</li>
  <li>User-Agent field (microedition.profiles and
   microedition.configuration)</li>
  <li>Accept field (*/* for HTML link, OTA MIME type for MIDlet-Jar-URL)</li>
  <li>Accept-Language field (microedition.locale)</li>
  <li>Accept-Charset field (UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1)</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>Checks that the JAD file and manifest contain the required properties</li>
<li>Ensures that the MIDlet suite can fit on the device</li>
<li>Compares the old and new URLs when updating a MIDlet suite</li>
<li>Checks for existing RMS data when updating a MIDlet suite, and removes it
 if required</li>
</ul>
<p>The Installer class does not support the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP redirection response codes</li>
</ul>
<p>The SecureInstaller class is a subclass of Installer and adds
 authentication of MIDlet suites that are signed with public keys. The figure
 below shows the SecureInstaller class and its dependencies with other Java
 stack implementation components.

<p><h2>AutoTester</h2>
</p>
<p>The AutoTester is a MIDlet that installs and runs sequences of tests
 without user intervention. The TCK and the QA Test Suite use this component.
 This MIDlet must not be included with the code on production implementations.
</p>
<p>In addition, the AutoTester includes the following functionality:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Enables the tester to assign a permission domain to unsigned test suites
 at a given URL. This provides automated testing without the requirement to
 sign test suites.</li>
<li>Removes the RMS record stores of the previous version of a MIDlet suite
 when it updates the suite.</li>
<li>Removes the last version of the test suite after the last test is run. The
 last test is indicated by a return code of 404 on the next update.</li>
<li>Waits and retries when an HTTP retry response code (505) is received from
 the test server.</li>
<li>Ends the testing immediately upon receipt of a system shutdown.</li>
<li>Tries to resume the testing by updating the test suite after an error,
 including a VM abort. The one exception is when the MIDlet suite cannot be
 found.</li>
<li>Provides a batch mode. It checks the application properties for the URL
 and permission domain before showing the parameters form to support running
 the AutoTester MIDlet from the command line in batch mode.</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Detailed Design</h3>
</p>
<p>The AutoTester is implemented in the <code>AutoTester</code> class of the
 com.sun.midp.installer package. It is considered part of the internal MIDlet
 suite of ROMized applications, and is granted the special permissions
 required to access classes from which externally installed suites are
 restricted.
</p>
<p>The AutoTester can run interactively or in batch mode. To run the
 AutoTester in batch mode, the test engineer must supply arg-0, and optionally
 can supply arg-1. If property arg-0 is present, the AutoTester uses it as the
 URL for the test suite. If arg-1 is present, the AutoTester uses it as the
 unsigned suite permission domain. In batch mode, the default permission
 domain is maximum. The maximum domain requires the least amount of tester
 interaction. If the user does not supply arg-0, the AutoTester runs
 interactively and queries the user for the two parameters.
</p>
<p>Note that none of the security of the MIDP runtime environment is bypassed
 to automate runtime API testing. Security checks cannot be accidentally or
 intentionally bypassed on the end-user device. Test engineers must conduct
 authentication and authorization installation testing interactively with the
 Graphical Installer, not the Autotester.
</p>
<p>AutoTester depends on the SecureInstaller and the MIDletSuiteStorage
 classes, as shown in the figure below. The AutoTest.startApp method starts
 the SecureInstaller in its own thread. If the installer does not return a
 result of "MIDlet suite not found", two calls are made in that thread to the
 MIDletSuiteStorage API. One call schedules the AutoTester to be the last
 MIDlet to be run (this how the MIDlet is looped). The other call schedules
 the installed suite to be the next suite run. At that point, the AutoTest
 MIDlet ends.
</p>
<p><img src="doc-files/autotester.gif" name="autotester" align="CENTER" border="0">
</p>
<p>The <code>SecureInstaller</code> performs the installer functions common to
 all Java platform installers, including HTTP handling, application
 verification, and application storage. See "Installer Services" on page 166
 for information. One part of the AutoTester that cannot be used in the Java
 layer is to retry when the VM aborts. To handle this, a loop was added to the
 native function that runs MIDlets.
</p>
<p>Unlike the Graphical Installer that queries users for information requested
 by the <code>SecureInstaller</code>, the AutoTester does not query the user.
 Instead, the
 AutoTester automatically provides yes for download confirmations and no for
 security questions and considers HTTP password requests as fatal errors.
<p>The figure below shows the sequence of actions taken by the AutoTester.
