/**
 * This MIDletStateHandler is a synchronous class that simply forwards
 * central AMS actions to a single MIDlet running in isolation.
 * <p>
 * The MIDletStateHandler is a singleton for the suite being run and
 * is retrieved with getMIDletStateHandler(). This allow the
 * MIDletStateHandler to be the anchor of trust internally for the MIDP API,
 * restricted methods can obtain the MIDletStateHandler for a MIDlet suite
 * inorder to check the properties and actions of a suite.
 * Because of this, there MUST only be one a MIDlet suite per
 * MIDletStateHandler.
 * <p>
 * The MIDlet methods are protected in the javax.microedition.midlet package
 * so the MIDletStateHandler can not call them directly.  The MIDletState
 * object and
 * MIDletTunnel subclass class allow the MIDletStateHandler to hold the state
 * of the
 * MIDlet and to invoke methods on it.  The MIDletState instance is created
 * by the MIDlet when it is constructed.
 * <p>
 * When a MIDlet changes its or requests to change its state to
 * the MIDlet state listener is notified of the change,
 * which in turn sends the notification onto the central AMS.
 * <p>
 * When a MIDlet state is changed by the central AMS there is no call to a
 * listener, since this is synchronous handler.
