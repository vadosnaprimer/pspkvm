/**
 * The LayerManager manages a series of Layers.  The LayerManager simplifies
 * the process of rendering the Layers that have been added to it by
 * automatically rendering the correct regions of each Layer in the
 * appropriate order.
 * <p>
 * The LayerManager maintains an ordered list to which Layers can be appended,
 * inserted and removed.  A Layer's index correlates to its z-order; the layer
 * at index 0 is closest to the user while a the Layer with the highest index
 * is furthest away from the user.  The indices are always contiguous; that
 * is, if a Layer is removed, the indices of subsequent Layers will be
 * adjusted to maintain continuity.
 * <p>
 * The LayerManager class provides several features that control how the
 * game's Layers are rendered on the screen.
 * <p>
 * The <em>view window</em> controls the size of the visible region and its
 * position relative to the LayerManager's coordinate system.  Changing the
 * position of the view window enables effects such as scrolling or panning
 * the user's view.  For example, to scroll to the right, simply move the view
 * window's location to the right.  The size of the view window controls how
 * large the user's view will be, and is usually fixed at a size that is
 * appropriate for the device's screen.
 * <P>
 * In this example, the view window is set to 85 x 85 pixels and is located at
 * (52, 11) in the LayerManager's coordinate system.  The Layers appear at
 * their respective positions relative to the LayerManager's origin.
 * <br>
 * <center><img src="doc-files/viewWindow.gif" width=558 height=292
 * ALT="Specifying the View Window"></center>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #paint(Graphics, int, int)} method includes an (x,y) location
 * that controls where the view window is rendered relative to the screen.
 * Changing these parameters does not change the contents of the view window,
 * it simply changes the location where the view window is drawn.  Note that
 * this location is relative to the origin of the Graphics object, and thus
 * it is subject to the translation attributes of the Graphics object.
 * <P>
 * For example, if a game uses the top of the screen to display the current
 * score, the view window may be rendered at (17, 17) to provide enough space
 * for the score.

     * <p>
     * The coordinates passed to this method determine where the

     * of the Graphics object.  For example, a game may use the top of the

     * <p>
     * Rendering is subject to the clip region and translation of the Graphics
     * object.  Thus, only part of the specified view window may be rendered
     * if the clip region is not large enough.
     * <p>
     * For performance reasons, this method may ignore Layers that are
     * invisible or that would be rendered entirely outside of the Graphics
     * object's clip region.  The attributes of the Graphics object are not
