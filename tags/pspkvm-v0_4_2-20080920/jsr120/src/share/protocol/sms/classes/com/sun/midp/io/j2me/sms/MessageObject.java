/**
 * Implements a SMS message for the SMS message connection.
 * <p>
 * This class contains methods for manipulating message objects and their
 * contents. Messages can be composed of data and an address.
 * <code>MessageObject</code> contains methods that can get and set the data and
 * the address parts of a message separately. The data part can be either text
 * or binary format. The address part has the format:
 * <p>
 * <code>sms://[<em>phone_number</em>:][<em>port_number</em>]</code>
 * <p>
 * and represents the address of a port that can accept or receive SMS messages.
 * <p>
 * Port numbers are used to designate a specific application or communication
 * channel for messages. When the port number is omitted from the address, then
 * the message is targeted at the end user and their normal mailbox handling
 * application. In this case, the JSR120 <code>MessageConnection</code> cannot
 * be used to receive an inbound message to the user mailbox.
 * <p>
 * A well-written application would always check the number of segments that 
 * would be used before sending a message, since the user is
 * paying for each SMS message transferred and not just the fixed rate per 
 * high-level message sent.</p>
 * <h2>Instantiating and Freeing MessageObjects</h2>
 * <p>
 * <code>MessageObject</code>s are instantiated when they are received from the
 * {@link javax.wireless.messaging.MessageConnection MessageConnection}
 * or by using the
 * {@link MessageConnection#newMessage(String type)
 *  MessageConnection.newMessage}
 * message factory. Instances are freed when they are garbage collected or
 * when they go out of scope.
