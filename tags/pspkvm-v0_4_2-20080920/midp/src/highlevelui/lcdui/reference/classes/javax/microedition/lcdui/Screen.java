/**
 * The common superclass of all high-level user interface classes. The 
 * contents displayed and their interaction with the user are defined by 
 * subclasses.
 *
 * <P>Using subclass-defined methods, the application may change the contents
 * of a <code>Screen</code> object while it is shown to the user.  If
 * this occurs, and the
 * <code>Screen</code> object is visible, the display will be updated
 * automatically.  That
 * is, the implementation will refresh the display in a timely fashion without
 * waiting for any further action by the application.  For example, suppose a
 * <code>List</code> object is currently displayed, and every element
 * of the <code>List</code> is
 * visible.  If the application inserts a new element at the beginning of the
 * <code>List</code>, it is displayed immediately, and the other
 * elements will be
 * rearranged appropriately.  There is no need for the application to call
 * another method to refresh the display.</P>
 *
 * <P>It is recommended that applications change the contents of a
 * <code>Screen</code> only
 * while it is not visible (that is, while another
 * <code>Displayable</code> is current).
 * Changing the contents of a <code>Screen</code> while it is visible
 * may result in
 * performance problems on some devices, and it may also be confusing if the
 * <code>Screen's</code> contents changes while the user is
 * interacting with it.</P>
 *
 * <P>In MIDP the four <code>Screen</code> methods that defined
 * read/write ticker and
 * title properties were moved to <code>Displayable</code>,
 * <code>Screen's</code> superclass.  The
 * semantics of these methods have not changed.</P>
