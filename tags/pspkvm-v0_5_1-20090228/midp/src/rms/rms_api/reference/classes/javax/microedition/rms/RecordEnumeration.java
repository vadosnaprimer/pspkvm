/**
 * An interface representing a bidirectional record store Record
 * enumerator. The RecordEnumeration logically maintains a sequence of
 * the recordId's of the records in a record store. The enumerator
 * will iterate over all (or a subset, if an optional record filter
 * has been supplied) of the records in an order determined by an
 * optional record comparator.
 *
 * <p>By using an optional <code>RecordFilter</code>, a subset of the
 * records can be chosen that match the supplied filter. This can be
 * used for providing search capabilities.</p>
 *
 * <p>By using an optional <code>RecordComparator</code>, the
 * enumerator can index through the records in an order determined by
 * the comparator. This can be used for providing sorting
 * capabilities.</p>
 *
 * <p>If, while indexing through the enumeration, some records are
 * deleted from the record store, the recordId's returned by the
 * enumeration may no longer represent valid records. To avoid this
 * problem, the RecordEnumeration can optionally become a listener of
 * the RecordStore and react to record additions and deletions by
 * recreating its internal index. Use special care when using this
 * option however, in that every record addition, change and deletion
 * will cause the index to be rebuilt, which may have serious
 * performance impacts.</p>
 *
 * <p>If the RecordStore used by this RecordEnumeration is closed,
 * this RecordEnumeration becomes invalid and all subsequent
 * operations performed on it may give invalid results or throw a
 * RecordStoreNotOpenException, even if the same RecordStore is later
 * opened again. In addition, calls to <code>hasNextElement()</code>
 * and <code>hasPreviousElement()</code> will return false.</p>
 *
 * <p>The first call to <code>nextRecord()</code> returns the record
 * data from the first record in the sequence. Subsequent calls to
 * <code>nextRecord()</code> return the next consecutive record's
 * data. To return the record data from the previous consecutive from
 * any given point in the enumeration, call
 * <code>previousRecord()</code>. On the other hand, if after
 * creation, the first call is to <code>previousRecord()</code>, the
 * record data of the last element of the enumeration will be
 * returned. Each subsequent call to <code>previousRecord()</code>
 * will step backwards through the sequence until the beginning is
 * reached.</p>
 *
 * <p>Final note, to do record store searches, create a
 * RecordEnumeration with no RecordComparator, and an appropriate
 * RecordFilter with the desired search criterion.</p>
