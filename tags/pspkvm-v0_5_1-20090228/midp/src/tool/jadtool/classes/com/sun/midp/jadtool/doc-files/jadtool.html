<h2>JAD Tool</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

The JAD Tool provides a command line interface to sign MIDlet suites using 
public key cryptography according to the MIDP specification. Signing a
MIDlet suite is the process of adding the signer certificate(s) and the
digital signature of the JAR to a JAD.
<p>
The JAD Tool only uses certificates and keys from Java<sup>tm</sup> Standard
Edition (J2SE) keystores. J2SE provides the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/win32/keytool.html">
command line tool</a> to manage J2SE keystores.</p>

The general usage for the JAD Tool is (from the MIDP home directory):
<blockquote>
  <code>java -jar bin/JadTool.jar</code> <i>(command followed by  arguments for the command)</i>
</blockquote>

The JAD Tool provides the following commands to:
<ul>
  <li>Display usage help text</li>
  <li>Add a provider certificate from a keystore to a JAD</li>
  <li>Add the digital signature of a JAR to a JAD</li>
  <li>Decode and display a provider certificate from a JAD</li>
</ul>
For shell script use, when a command is successful, the status code upon
completion will be "0" and if there is an error it will be "-1".

<h3>General Argument Parsing Considerations</h3>

Properly producing user friendly command line argument errors requires a
great deal of code, and since this tool is not intended for the general
public, this tool with have very simple option
parsing that will lead to to some less then user friendly error conditions.
Like the J2SE "java" command, any potentially valid value for an option will be
accepted for that option even if it looks like a option flag. No positive
case will be disallowed to make the errors more user friendly. Basically the
tool will make only ensure that option values are formated according to the
specification of the underlying Java APIs.

<h3>JAD File Arguments</h3>

The argument for the input JAD filename is "-inputjad" followed by a
filename. The argument for the output JAD filename is "-outputjad" followed
by a filename. The filenames can any valid name the file system allows.
If a command only reads a JAD, it is an error to give an output JAD.
If the input and output JAD filenames are the same the output JAD will
replace the input JAD.
<p>
The default character encoding for a JAD is UTF-8, to the override this,
use the argument "-encoding" followed by an alternate encoding.</p>

<h3>Display Usage Help Text</h3>

The command to display help text is "-help". There are no arguments for the
command. The usage text is also displayed when JAD Tool arguments are 
not in the correct format or missing. The usage text is:
<blockquote><pre>
JadTool arguments:
-help
-addcert
        -alias &lt;key alias&gt; [-storepass &lt;password&gt;] [-keystore &lt;keystore&gt;]
        [-certnum &lt;number&gt;] [-chainnum &lt;number&gt;]
        [-encoding &lt;encoding&gt;] -inputjad &lt;filename&gt; -outputjad &lt;filename&gt;
-addjarsig
        [-jarfile &lt;filename&gt;] -keypass &lt;password&gt; -alias &lt;key alias&gt;
        [-storepass &lt;password&gt;] [-keystore &lt;keystore&gt;] [-encoding &lt;encoding&gt;]
         -inputjad &lt;filename&gt; -outputjad &lt;filename&gt;
-showcert
        [([-certnum &lt;number&gt;] [-chainnum &lt;number&gt;]) | -all]
        [-encoding &lt;encoding&gt;]  -inputjad &lt;filename&gt;

        The default for -encoding is UTF-8.
        The default for -jarfile is the MIDlet-Jar-URL property in the JAD.
        The default for -keystore is "$HOME/.keystore".
        The default for -certnum is 1.
        The default for -chainnum is 1.
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Adding a Certificate to a JAD</h3>

The command for adding a certificate to a JAD is "-addcert". In addition
to the JAD file arguments above, the command has the following arguments:
<ul>
  <li>"-alias" followed by the alias of the certificate, this is required to
    find the certificate in the keystore.</li>
  <li>"-keystore" followed by the filename of a J2SE keystore from
    which the get certificate. If not provided, the tool will assume
    the filename of the keystore is $HOME/.keystore.
    This is consistent with J2SE keytool.</li>
  <li>"-storepass" followed by a password to unlock the keystore if
    needed.</li>
  <li>"-certnum" followed by number of certificate in the signer certificate
    chain. This is only needed to replace a certificate, since if the number
    is not given it will be calculated automatically to be the next number in
    the chain. Numbers start at "1".</li>
  <li>"-chainnum" followed by number of a signer certificate chain.
    If not given, "1" is used.</li>
</ul>

The following steps are performed when adding a certificate to a JAD.
<ol>
  <li>Read the input JAD into memory.</li>
  <li>Get the certificate from the keystore.</li>
  <li>Encode the certificate as base64.</li>
  <li>Add the base64 encode certificate as the value of a
    MIDlet-Certificate-m-&lt;n&gt; attribute to the JAD in memory,
    where m is the given chain number and where n is the given certificate
    number. If the certificate is already in the JAD is replaced.</li>
  <li>Write the JAD in memory to the output JAD file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Adding a JAR Signature to a JAD</h3>

Adding a JAR signature to a JAD, also creates a the JAR signature using a
private key from a J2SE keystore.
<p>
The command for adding the signature of a JAR to a JAD is "-addjarsig".
In addition to the JAD file arguments above, the command has the following
arguments:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"-alias" followed by the alias of the private key. This is required to
    find the key in the keystore.</li>
  <li>"-keystore" followed by the filename of a J2SE keystore from
    which the get private key. If not provided, the tool will assume
    the filename of the keystore is $HOME/.keystore.
    This is consistent with J2SE keytool.</li>
  <li>"-storepass" followed by a password to unlock the keystore, if
    needed</li>
  <li>"-keypass" followed by a password to unlock the private key
    used to sign the JAR</li>
  <li>"-jarfile" followed by the filename of the JAR.
    If not given and the MIDlet-Jar-URL attribute is present and has a valid
    HTTP URL, then the input JAR will downloaded using the URL over the
    network.</li>
</ul>
Example of JAR signature attribute (line breaks added for readability):
<blockquote><pre>

</pre></blockquote>
The following steps are performed when adding the signature of JAR to a
JAD.
<ol>
  <li>Read the input JAD into memory.</li>
  <li>Get the private key from the keystore.</li>
  <li>Open an input stream of the JAR for the signing step.</li>
  <li>Sign the JAR using the EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5 encoding method of PKCS #1
    version 2.0 standard[RFC2437] with the private key.</li>
  <li>Encode the signature in base64.</li>
  <li>Add the base64 encoded signature as the value a MIDlet-Jar-RSA-SHA1
    attribute to the JAD in memory. If a signature attribute is already
    in the JAD, it is replaced.</li>
  <li>Write the JAD in memory to the output JAD file.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Displaying a Certificate from a JAD</h3>

The command for displaying a certificate from a JAD is "-showcert". The
command can also display all of the certificates in the JAD. In addition
to the JAD input file and encoding arguments above, the command has the
following arguments:
<ul>
  <li>"-certnum" followed by number of certificate in the signer certificate
    chain. If not given "1" is used.</li>
  <li>"-chainnum" followed by number of a signer certificate chain.
    If not given, "1" is used.</li>
  <li>"-all". Only valid when -certnum and "-chainnum" are not used.</li>
</ul>
Example of certificate display:
<blockquote><pre>
Subject: C=myserver, O=Sun Microsystems
Issuer : C=myserver, O=Sun Microsystems
Serial number: 3cb4fae4
Valid from Wed Apr 10 22:54:28 EDT 2002 to Sat Apr 07 22:54:28 EDT 2012
Certificate fingerprints:
  MD5: 29:bc:e2:28:b9:7f:76:4a:b2:c5:b4:9c:aa:80:4e:be
  SHA: b2:1c:4e:ec:47:7c:13:a4:62:46:f9:d7:cc:3a:e2:f4:f3:3a:6f:6f
</pre></blockquote>
It should be noted, that the attributes in the subject and issuer names in the
example above are in reverse order from what is in the certificate. This
is a side effect of using the J2SE certificate API to get the subject and
issuer fields from the certificate, so display the name may not match other
tools that display a certificate's subject.
<p>
The following steps are performed when displaying a certificate from a JAD.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read the input JAD into memory.</li>
  <li>If "-all" was given as argument get all of the certificates from the
    JAD. If there are not certificate found display "No certificates found
    in JAD." and exit. Otherwise skip the next step, and for each certificate
    found perform the all the steps after the next.</li>
  <li>Get the base64 encode certificate attribute
    MIDlet-Certificate-m-&lt;n&gt; attribute from the JAD,
    where m is the given chain number and where n is the given certificate
    number.</li>
  <li>Decode the certificate into a byte array.</li>
  <li>Create a J2SE certificate object.</li>
  <li>Print out to standard output, the subject, issuer, serial number,
    and validity fields of the certificate object along with MD5 and SHA-1
    fingerprints of the raw bytes of the certificate.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Error Conditions</h3>

Not all error messages are created by the JAD Tool code, the
tool relies on the java.security and java.io classes to generate messages.
So only when an error condition has a message created by the MIDP implementation code,
will the full message be specified. This is because the message not
under control of the MIDP implementation can change at anytime and this cannot be
considered a bug.
