  <body>
    MID Profile Language Classes included from Java 2 Standard
    Edition. In addition to the <code>java.lang</code> classes
    specified in the Connected Limited Device Configuration the
    Mobile Information Device Profile includes the following
    class from Java 2 Standard Edition. 

    <ul>
      <li>java.lang.IllegalStateException.java</li>
    </ul>

    <p><code>IllegalStateException</code>s are thrown when illegal 
      transitions are requested, such as scheduling a 
      <code>TimerTask</code> or in the containment of 
      user interface components.</p>


    <H2>System Functions </H2>

    <P>
      The MIDP is based on the Connected, Limited Device Configuration
      (CLDC). Some features of the CLDC are modified or extended by the
      MIDP.</P>
    
    
    <H2>System Properties</H2>
    <P>
      The MIDP defines the following property values (in addition to
      those defined in the CLDC specification) that MUST be made
      available to the application using
      <CODE>java.lang.System.getProperty</CODE> :</P>
    <TABLE BORDER="2">
      <H6>
	System Properties Defined by MIDP</H6>
      <TR>
	<TH ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
	  <P>
	    System Property</P>
	</TH>
	<TH ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
	  <P>
	    Description</P>
	</TH>
      </TR>
      <TR>
	<TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
	  <P>
	    <CODE>
	      microedition.locale</CODE>
	  </P>
	</TD>
	<TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
	  <P>
	    The current locale of the device, may be <CODE>null</CODE></P>
	</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
	<TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
	  <P>
	    <CODE>
	      microedition.profiles</CODE>
	  </P>
	</TD>
	<TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1">
	  <P>
	  is a blank (Unicode U+0020) separated list of the J2ME profiles
	  that this device supports. For MIDP devices, this
	  property MUST contain at least &quot;MIDP-2.0&quot;</P>
	</TD>
      </TR>
    </TABLE>
    
    <P>Other properties may be available from other profiles or 
      the implementation.</P>

    <EM>
      Property microedition.locale</EM>
    <P>
      The locale property, if not <CODE>null</CODE>, MUST consist of
      the language and MAY optionally also contain the country code,
      and variant separated by &quot;-&quot; (Unicode U+002D). For example,
      &quot;fr-FR&quot; or &quot;en-US.&quot; 

      (Note: the MIDP 1.0 specification used the HTTP formatting of
      language tags as defined in 
      <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt">RFC3066</A>
      <EM>Tags for the Identification of
      Languages</EM>. This is different from the J2SE definition
      for <code>Locale</code> printed strings where fields are
      separated by &quot;_&quot; (Unicode U+005F).
      )
    </P>

    <P>
      The language codes MUST be the lower-case, two-letter codes as
      defined by <A
      HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt">ISO-639</A>.</P>
    <P>
      The country code MUST be the upper-case, two-letter codes as
      defined by <A
      HREF="http://www.chemie.fu-berlin.de/diverse/doc/ISO_3166.html">ISO-3166</A>.</P>



    <H2>Application Resource Files</H2>
    <P>
      Application resource files are accessed using 
      <CODE>getResourceAsStream(String name)</CODE>
      in 
      <CODE>java.lang.Class</CODE>
      . In the MIDP specification, 
      <CODE>getResourceAsStream</CODE>
      is used to allow resource files to be retrieved from the MIDlet
      Suite's JAR file. </P>
    <P>
      Resource names refer to the contents of the MIDlet Suite JAR file.
      Absolute pathnames, beginning with &quot;/&quot; are fully qualified file
      names within the jar file.</P>
      
    <P>Relative pathnames, not beginning with &quot;/&quot; are
      relative to the class upon which
      <CODE>getResourceAsStream</CODE> is called.  Relative names are
      converted to absolute by prepending a &quot;/&quot; followed by
      the fully qualified package with &quot;.&quot; characters
      converted to &quot;/&quot; and a separator of &quot;/&quot;.
      The resulting string is reduced to canonical form by applying
      as many times as possible the following:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>All occurrences of &quot;/./&quot;  are replaced with
	&quot;/&quot;.</LI> 
      <LI>All occurrences of &quot;/segment/../&quot; are replaced
	with &quot;/&quot; where segment does not contain
	&quot;/&quot;.</LI> 
    </UL>
    <P>The canonical resource name is the absolute pathname of
      the resource within the JAR.</P>
    <P>In no case can the path extend outside the JAR file, and
      resources outside the JAR file MUST NOT be accessible. For
      example, using "../../" does NOT point outside the JAR
      file.
      If there are any remaining &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot;
      characters they are treated literally in locating the
      resource. No resource can exist with that name so
      <code>null</code> is returned from
      <code>Class.getResourceAsStream</code>.
      Also, devices MUST NOT allow classfiles to be read from
      the JAR file as resources, but all other files MUST be
      accessible.</P>

    <H2> System.exit</H2>
    <P>
      The behavior of 
      <CODE>java.lang.System.exit</CODE>
      MUST throw a 
      <CODE>java.lang.SecurityException</CODE>
      when invoked by a MIDlet. The only way a MIDlet can indicate that it
      is complete is by calling 
      <CODE>MIDlet.notifyDestroyed</CODE>
      .</P>
    
    
    <H2>Runtime.exit</H2>
    <P>
      The behavior of 
      <CODE>java.lang.Runtime.exit</CODE>
      MUST throw a
      <CODE>java.lang.SecurityException</CODE>
      when invoked by a MIDlet. The only way a MIDlet can indicate that it
      is complete is by calling 
      <CODE> MIDlet.notifyDestroyed</CODE>
      .</P>
