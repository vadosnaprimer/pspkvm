 *
 * Porting API for Native Input Modes (NIMs)
 *
 * A number of input modes is implemented in Java. On the other hand,
 * the platform may also support some input modess, either unique
 * or analogous to those implemented in Java. The purpose of this API
 * is to let MIDP use input modes implemented on platform.
 * Please note that there's a separate API for Predictive Text Input (PTI).
 *
 * <b>Multiple native input modes: how.</b>
 * Native Input Modes are represented by instances of the NativeInputMode
 * class. In case that there is more than one native input mode, the field
 * NativeInputMode.id may be used to determine which one is meant.
 * NativeInputMode.id is an integer that may be used as a switch-case
 * selector expression, or as an index into an array of C++ objects that
 * implement different input methods, or in some other way.
 *
 * The id of a native input mode MUST be equal to or greater
 * than the NATIVE_INPUT_MODE_START value.
 *
 * <b>Where to keep data.</b>
 * The NativeInputMode.instanceData field may store a pointer to a memory
 * area containing the native input mode data. Native functions may modify
 * that field, for example, storing there an address of some allocated
 * memory area containing data.
 *
 * <b>Getting id and data.</b>
 * All functions that implement NativeInputMode member functions receive
 * the following two parameters: jint id, jint* pInstanceData.
 * The value id is a copy of NativeInputMode.id, and pInstanceData
 * is the address of the NativeInputMode.instanceData field
 * (within a Java object).
 *
 * <b>Workaround to call Java; the Java wrapper.</b>
 * Sometimes a native function will need to call Java functions.
 * It is complex to achieve this directly.
 * The following workaround is used instead:<br>
 * - the native function that needs to call Java code has a Java wrapper,
 * a Java member function in the same class;<br>
 * - the native function may be called only via its wrapper;<br>
 * - instead of calling Java code, the native function returns control
 * to its Java wrapper, and the wrapper calls the required Java function,
 * and then calls the native function again;<br>
 * - a state_data array is used to pass information between the native
 * function and its Java wrapper, and between subsequent invocations
 * of the native function;<br>
 * - the native function cannot use automatic memory for its local
 * variables, because such variables have lifetime of one invocation,
 * while a lifetime of several subsequent invocactions is needed;<br>
 * -  instead of using automatic memory, the native function has to explicitly
 * allocate a structure containing all its local variables and store
 * its address into the state_data array; the last invocation MUST
 * free this structure.
 *
 * <b>Functions calling Java as finite-state machines.</b>
 * Such native function may be considered a state machine.
 * One integer in the state_data array is intended for the state id.
 * In the simplest case, state id is the invocation number
 * (there will be, say, 5 states: 0,1,2,3,4).
 * In a bit more complex case, state id is not necessarily incremented
 * at each invocation: for example, the state 3 may be followed by
 * either state 4 or state 2.
 *
 * <b>0 as finite-state machine stopper.</b>
 * 0 is a special state id: the wrapper function repeats invocations of the
 * native function until state is is 0. Initially, the state id is 0,
 * so if the native function does not modify this value, it gets called
 * only once.
 *
 * <b>What information is passed to/from wrapper and from one invocation
 * to another.</b>
 * The state_data array (used for repeated invocations) has room for:<br>
 * - an argument for a Java function (STATE_INT_ARG);<br>
 * - result from the Java function (STATE_CALLBACK_RES);<br>
 * - an integer id showing which function is meant (STATE_FUNC_TOKEN);<br>
 * - an integer indicating which state the native function is
 * in (STATE_NEXT_STATE, the name comes from the fact that this
 * value is set/read before the corresponding state is entered);<br>
 * - the result to be returned by the Java wrapper
 * function (STATE_FINAL_RES);<br>
 * - pointers to data allocated by the native
 * function (STATE_INTERNAL and STATE_INTERNAL_EXT).<br>
 * For layout of state_data array, see nim_process_key().
 *
 * <b>Why need to call Java functions. Mediator.</b>
 * Input mode and input session objects communicate via
 * the InputModeMediator interface. Each input mode has
 * a <code>InputModeMediator mediator</code> instance member
 * and communicates to the session by calling <code>mediator</code>'s
 * functions. In particular, an instance of NativeInputMode,
 * whose functions are implemented in C, also must call InputModeMediator
 * functions. But these are the only Java functions that need be called.
 *
 * <b>Java functions that may be executed.</b>
 * The set of Java functions whose execution may be forced from native code
 * is limited to a few functions on the NativeInputMode.mediator object.
 * See @ref function_tokens.
 *
 * <b>Passing values to Java functions.</b>
 * First of all, the only native function that interacts with Java in this way
 * is nim_process_key().<br>
 * - If the Java function does not take any arguments, you don't
 * have to pass anything.<br>
 * - If the function takes one integer argument, store it into the state_data
 * array at index STATE_INT_ARG.<br>
 * - If the function takes one String argument, nim_process_key must store
 * it to the output pcsl_string parameter and return the value 1.<br>
 * With the current set of invocable Java functions, one int argument
 * and/or one String argument is enough.
 *
 * <b>Getting return values from Java functions.</b>
 * The integer return value may be found in the state_data
 * array at index STATE_CALLBACK_RES. If the return function is of type
 * void, you don't need any return value. And with the current set
 * of invocable Java functions there's no need to support other types
 * of return values.
 *
 * <b>Execution of Java functions and re-invocation of the native function
 * are independent.</b>
 * The "function token" integer (its index is STATE_FUNC_TOKEN) is
 * initially set to 0, which means "no operation", and gets reset
 * to 0 after each execution of a mediator function.
 * Re-invocation of the native function does not depend on whether or not
 * a mediator function is to be executed, in particular, the last invocation
 * also may order execution of a mediator function.
