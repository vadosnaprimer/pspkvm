/**
 * Launches a native text editor enabling editing of native locale languages
 * The text editor may possibly display initial text.
 * 
 * 
 * Handling of "VM-Pause" while a native textbox is displayed:
 * i. In asynchronous case:
 * Prior to sending a VM-Pause event, the platform is responsible for 
 *          (1) closing the textbox, 
 *          (2) sending a "cancel" event 
 *          
 *
 * ii. In synchronous case:
 * Prior to sending a VM-Pause event, the function should return immediately 
 * with return code JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CANCEL.
 * 
 * @param textBuffer a pointer to a global input text parameter 
 *  that holds the text string in unicode characters (UTF-16).
 *	When launching, the native editor should use the existing text in the 
 *	buffer as initial text (the first textBufferLength charachters), and should 
 *	update the buffer when the native editor is quit.
 * @param textBufferLength a pointer a global parameter that will hold the 
 *  current length of text, in unicode charachters.
 *	The native editor should update this value upon editor 
 *	quitting to the actual size of the input text.
 * @param textBufferMaxLength maximum length of input text. the user should not
 *	be allowed to exceed it.
 * @param caretPos a pointer to a global variable that holds the current 
 *  position of the caret in the text editor,in unicode charachters.
 *	The native editor should update this value upon quitting the editor 
 *  to the new caret location.
 * @param title a pointer to the title of the text editor, or null if a title 
 *	should not be displayed
 * @param titleLength length of title, in unicode charachters, or 0 if there is
 *	no title 
 * @param inputMode implementation of this feature is optional in MIDP2.0 specification.
 *	a pointer to a name of a Unicode character subset, which identifies a 
 *	particular input mode which should be used when the text editor is launched.
 *	the input mode is not restrictive, and the user is allowed to change it 
 *	during editing. For example, if the current constraint is 
 *	JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CONSTRAINT_ANY, and the requested input mode is "JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_UPPERCASE_LATIN",
 *	then the initial input mode is set to allow  entry of uppercase Latin 
 *	characters. the user will be able to enter other characters by switching 
 *	the input mode to allow entry of numerals or lowercase Latin letters.
 *	for more details, reffer to MIDP2.0 specification.
 * @param inputModeLength length of inputMode, in unicode charachters, or 0 if 
 *	there is no inputMode
 * @param constraint Input constraint, as defined in the <i>MIDP 2.0 Specification</i>
 *  possible values are:
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CONSTRAINT_ANY
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CONSTRAINT_EMAILADDR
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CONSTRAINT_NUMERIC     
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CONSTRAINT_PHONENUMBER 
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CONSTRAINT_URL         
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CONSTRAINT_DECIMAL
 * @param modifiers Input modifiers, as defined in the <i>MIDP 2.0 Specification</i>
 *	a bit-wise OR of zero or more of the following modifiers can be set:
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_MODIFIER_PASSWORD
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_MODIFIER_UNEDITABLE
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_MODIFIER_SENSITIVE
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_MODIFIER_NON_PREDICTIVE
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_MODIFIER_INITIAL_CAPS_WORD
 *		JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_MODIFIER_INITIAL_CAPS_SENTENCE 
 * @param keyCode the first key that the user pressed that should be inserted to the text box
 *
 * @return should return one of the following statuses:
 *	JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_COMMIT if the function is synchronous and the user pressed 
 *	"ok" to commit the text and quit the editor
 *	JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CANCEL if the function is synchronous and the user pressed 
 *	"cancel" to cancel the editing and quit the editor
 *	JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_ERROR if the operation failed, or if the native editor 
 *	could not be launched
 *	JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_WOULDBLOCK if the function is asynchronous, an 
 *	event/notification will be sent upon editor quitting. when the 
 *	evnt/notofocation is later sent, it should contain info about the editor 
 *	termination manner, can be one of:JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_COMMIT, JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_CANCEL, 
 *	or JAVACALL_TEXTFIELD_ERROR, as descibed above.
