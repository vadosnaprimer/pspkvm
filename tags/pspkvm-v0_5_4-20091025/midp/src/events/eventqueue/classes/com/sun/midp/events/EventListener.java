/**
 * A listener interface for preprocessing and receiving MIDP events.
 * <p>
 * Each system that wants to receive events implements an EventListener and
 * registers the listener with the EventQueue for each event type to be
 * received. Registration will require a system issued security token to
 * prevent unauthorized registrations, to get this token the system will
 * implement a static method to be called at VM startup. The EventListener
 * interface has methods for pre-processing
 * an event and receiving an event. The pre-processing method gets
 * called in the Java thread that is inserting an event when the event is the
 * type that it was registered for with a reference to the event to inserted
 * and the previously inserted event (if there is one). If the pre-processing
 * method merges the events and does not want does not want the new event
 * inserted into the queue, then it will return false. The receiving method
 * gets called in the event delivery thread with the first event of the type
 * of it registered for in the queue.</p>
