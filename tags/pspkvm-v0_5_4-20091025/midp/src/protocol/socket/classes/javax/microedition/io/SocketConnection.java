/**
 * This interface defines the socket stream connection.
 * <P>
 * A socket is accessed using a generic connection string with an explicit host 
 * and port number. The host may be specified as a fully qualified host name or 
 * IPv4 number.
 * e.g. <code>socket://host.com:79</code> defines a target socket on the 
 * <code>host.com</code> system at 
 * port <code>79</code>.
 * <P>Note that 
 * RFC1900 recommends the use of names rather than IP numbers for best results
 * in the event of IP number reassignment. </P>
 * <H3> Closing Streams </H3>
 * <P>
 * Every <code>StreamConnection</code> provides a <code>Connection</code>
 * object as well as an <code>InputStream</code> and <code>OutputStream</code>
 * to handle the I/O associated with the connection. Each of these interfaces
 * has its own <code>close()</code> method. For systems that support
 * duplex communication over the socket connection, closing of the 
 * input or output stream SHOULD shutdown just that side of the 
 * connection. e.g. closing the <code>InputStream</code> will permit the
 * <code>OutputStream</code> to continue sending data.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * Once the input or output stream has been closed, it can only be reopened
 * with a call to <code>Connector.open()</code>. The application will receive
 * an <code>IOException</code> if an attempt is made to reopen the stream.
 * </P>
 * <H2>
 * BNF Format for Connector.open() string
 * </H2>
 * <P>
 * The URI must conform to the BNF syntax specified below.  If the URI
 * does not conform to this syntax, an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>
 * is thrown.
