/**
 * Handles the properties in a JAR manifest. Each property is know as a header
 * in the syntax definition. A line that begins with a space is a continuation
 * of the previous line, and the first space ignored. To save code this
 * manifest parser uses lets its super class parse the key and value
 * of property once it has read the entire line, including continuation lines.
 * This means that this parser is lax on reporting illegal characters.
 * <p>
 * The BNF for the manifest syntax included below is extended as follows:
 * <pre>
 *    ":":separates the name and value of a rule
 *    +: 1 or more
 *    *: 0 or more
 *    {}: encloses a list of alternatives
 *    ;: comment
 *    terminals can also be represented in UPPER CASE
 *    non-terminals are not encluded in angle brackets
 * </pre><p>
 * Syntax definition from the manifest spec:
 * <p>
 * In most cases, information contained within the manifest file or
 * signature files is represented as so-called "name: value" pairs
 * inspired by the RFC822 standard.
 * <p>
 * Groups of name-value pairs are known as a "section". Sections are
 * separated from other sections by empty lines. 
 * <p>
 * Binary data of any form is represented as base64. Continuations are
 * required for binary data which causes line length to exceed 72
 * bytes. Examples of binary data are digests and signatures.
 * <p>
 * Implementations shall support header values of up to 65535 bytes.
 * <pre>
 *  section: *header +newline
 *  nonempty-section: +header +newline
 *  newline: CR LF | LF | CR (not followed by LF)
 *
 *  ; That 'not followed by LF' probably requires some minor
 *  ; ugliness in the parser. Sorry.
 *
 *  header: alphanum *headerchar ":" SPACE *otherchar newline
 *          *continuation
 *
 *  continuation: SPACE *otherchar newline
 *
 *  ; RFC822 has +(SPACE | TAB), but this way continuation lines 
 *  ; never get mangled.
 *
 *  alphanum: {"A"-"Z"} | {"a"-"z"} | {"0"-"9"}
 *
 *  headerchar: alphanum | "-" | "_"
 *
 *  otherchar: any Unicode character except NUL, CR and LF
 *
 *  ; Also: To prevent mangling of files sent via straight e-mail, no 
 *  ; header will start with the four letters "From".
 *
 *  ; When version numbering is used:
 *
 *  number: {"0"-"9"}+
 *
 *  ; The number needn't be, e.g. 1.11 is considered to be later
 *  ; than 1.9. Both major and minor versions must be 3 digits or less.
 *</pre>
