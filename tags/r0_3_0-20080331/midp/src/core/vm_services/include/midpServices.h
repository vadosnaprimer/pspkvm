 * Structure to hold contextual information across thread blocking, awakening,

 * 
 * This structure is used at three different times:
 * 
 * (1) It is populated at the time the thread is blocked.
 *
 * (2) It is read at the time an event occurs and the notifying code wishes to 
 * awaken one or more threads. 
 *
 * (3) It is available to the native method when it is reinvoked.
 *
 * The waitingFor field defines the namespace within which descriptor values 
 * reside. When searching for threads to be signaled, both the waitingFor and 
 * descriptor fields must match the arguments to the signal call.
 *
 * The status field can be set at time (2) by the notifying code in order to 
 * pass status to the reinvoked native method at time (3).
 *
 * The pResult field can be set at time (1) for use at time (3). The notifying
 * code at time (2) should not set or get this field. The reason is that
 * pResult may require native memory allocation, and notification may occur on
 * zero or many threads, which makes dealing with native memory allocation 
 * difficult.
