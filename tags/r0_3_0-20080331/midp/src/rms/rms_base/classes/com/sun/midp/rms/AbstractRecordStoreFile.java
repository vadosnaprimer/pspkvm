 * A RecordStoreFile is a file abstraction layer between a

 * RecordStoreFile confines the namespace of a record store to
 * the scope of the MIDlet suite of its creating application.
 * It also ensures unicode recordstore names are ascii filesystem safe.
 *
 * The RecordStoreImpl class can be implemented directly using the
 * RandomAccessStream and File classes.  However,
 * RecordStoreFile served as the java/native code boundary for
 * RMS in the MIDP 1.0 release.  It exists now for
