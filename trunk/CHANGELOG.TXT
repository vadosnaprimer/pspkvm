Additional documentation
------------------------

 * See Readme.txt for user tips and general project information.
 * See BUILDING.TXT for notes on building this software.
  
-------------------------------------------------
Changes for release version (relative to test 11)
-------------------------------------------------

 * Refactored Danzeff keymaps, separated from board implementation for easy addition of support for additional alphabets/scripts/etc.

 * Did heavy, general refactoring of all virtual board implementations--reduced redundant code.  

 * Fixed default glyph handling in built-in font
 
 * Added support for a few columns of Unicode page 0x20 (typographic quotes, dashes, ellipsis) to built-in font... means text with typographic style quotes &c. renders correctly with built-in font.  

 * Fixed command semantics in rename/name form for AMS folders

 * QWERTY virtual keyboard implementation now has smart placement.

 * You may now set Pinyin or Stroke as the default map for AWF/Float   

---------------------------------
Changes relative to test build 10
---------------------------------

 * Changed colours of Danzeff/semichordal keys to make distinguishing them easy.

 * Streamlined command handling in Virtual boards--all boards now allow direct entry of commands registered by midlet authors without going through the interim text context layer. Semichordal and Danzeff boards also bind appropriate keys to OK and CANCEL command types if the midlet author registers them correctly. Allows single keystroke return from full-screen text fields in many midlets, including Opera Mini.

 * Added experimental, compact 'floating' version of AWF virtual board.
 
 * AMS warns when you attempt to move a folder into itself or into its own child.

 * Changed Config midlet 'Exit' to 'Done'.

 * AMS allows deleting of non-empty folders.

 * Improvements to smart positioning system in virtual keyboards, so they move properly around one-line textfields in forms.

 * (non-UI/non-user) added Java interfaces exposing native to J2ME control mapping--necessary to get AWF board operating properly when keys are remapped by user or 'Western' X/O mapping is selected.

 * (developer support only) added midlet tree with test midlets, simple midlet build system
 
 * (developer support only) added art, generating scripts to svn tree.


----------------------------------
Previous changeset (test build 10)
----------------------------------

Summary: critical bugfixes, few minor cleanups

 * Bugfix: 'zombie midlet' bug in which marked, removed midlets would reappear
on a subsequent move has been fixed. Loading code has also been modified to allow
loading of the folder system in the AMS even after a crash due to this bug. If
you got locked out of your VM because of this, using this build will let you back
in.

 * Bugfix: missing utility/symbols file no longer brings down the VM when
opening virtual keyboards using it.

 * Bugfix: unused menu items removed from Danzeff board.     

----------------------------------------
Changes in previous 0.5.4 interim builds
----------------------------------------

There's a Danzeff-style virtual keyboard available now. See the VM Configuration
midlet to enable it.

The AMS supports folders.

The semichordal board supports Greek and Cyrillic scripts, and you can customize
which one you want to come up by default in the VM Config midlet.

The semichordal board now uses a custom TrueType utility font (utility.ttf) for its
help display/nav display.

The FreeType font system now supports all three fonts (proportional, monospace,
system) and bold, italic, bold/italic faces for all three, in addition to a
utility font for speeding up certain system GUI displays, a 'fallback font'
useful for large Han (CJK) fonts, and uses the FreeType portable cache manager
to speed rendering and allow loading much larger font files than previously. It
has been tested with 18 MB of fonts loaded with no errors.

There are fixes to network setup that *should* prevent unrecoverable network
dropout issue in previous builds. Generally, reconnecting from the Wifi Manager
midlet should now work. Test users please report if this is the case.

The Danzeff and semichordal boards support a 'smart display' feature, in which
they move out of the way of the active input area in large text boxes.

The Danzeff board display is slightly reduced in size from the previous build.

There are additional icons in the AMS, VM configuration and network setup
screens--the hope is to make thing a little easier on non-English speakers
until we can get some proper translation going here.

Virtual keyboards and Freetype setup are now configured in the GUI, not in the .ini.

 * The X/O keys are now fully switchable system-wide, for Western-style
accept/cancel use. Use the VM Configuration midlet -> Keymap settings menu
to set these keys. The settings take effect immediately after you exit the
configuration midlet.

Note that for midlets whose keymaps or device settings you've customized, you'll
have to set the accept key yourself in the Device Settings screen if you wish
them to change too (and if you haven't changed them already). Set 'Select' to
'Cross' and 'Num0' to 'Circle' to emulate the default Western layout, in this
case. Midlets whose device settings you have not customized will use the default
ones, and so will pick up the change without additional tweaking.

Note also that the old com.pspkvm.acceptcross setting for native dialogs is
gone. The setting in the VM config midlet will affect these dialogs, the AMS,
and the default keymap setting. Set it to 'Western' to use X=accept, to 'Eastern'
to use O=accept.

 * Keystroke handling in the Danzeff board has been tightened for faster
response.

 * The 'smart display' feature in the semichordal and Danzeff boards, wherein the
board displays move to stay out of your way when you're typing, has been optimized,
streamlined, and some bugs have been removed.

 * Live display in the semichordal board now places the small layout correctly.

 * The semichordal display has been greatly reduced in size, and its appearance
brought more into line with the Danzeff display. Status display for the live
keymap has also been added (Cyrillic/Greek/Roman).

 * The Danzeff board now has a status bar which displays selection state.

 * The diacritics (accents) deadkey glyphs for the semichordal display have been
modified to make them easier to read.

 * Bugfix: smart display-capable boards now move properly on all key entries.

 * Bugfix: the Danzeff board now displays correctly when the system is using
the internal font.

 * Bugfix: thread shutdown for the Danzeff board's analog stick monitor has been
fixed; threads previously remained around when the board was absent. They now
start when the board appears, and exit when the board disappears.

 * Bugfix: prevented all virtual boards from crashing constrained fields
(numerical, URL, etc.) due to pasting in of text containing constrained
characters. Internal interfaces now sift input correctly.

 * Renamed utility.ttf to utility.sym so people stop assuming they can just 
delete it.

 * Bugfix: the Danzeff board should now work correctly with 'use internal font'
turned on. 

 * Tools for built-in font manipulation (midp/src/tools/fontgen/...) updated to work with current bitmap files.

 * Built-in font now supports basic Cyrillic characters in Unicode range 0x0400 to 0x045f (should support Russian, Ukrainian, Macedonian, Byelorussian).
