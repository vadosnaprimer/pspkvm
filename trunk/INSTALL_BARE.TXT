Install directions for bare eboot packages
------------------------------------------

This is a minimal 'bare eboot' package, which corrects issues or adds features
in the binary EBOOT.PBP file only. To use it, unzip it, and replace the
EBOOT.PBP in your  current PSPKVM installation directory with the one in this
package.
