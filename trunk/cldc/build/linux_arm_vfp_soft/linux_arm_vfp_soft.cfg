# Build Linux/ARM for Linux 2.6 with VFP support, but by-pass the VFP
# support code in the Linux kernel. All FP operations that (1) are
# "bounced" by the VFP hardware, or (2) cause FP exceptions, are
# re-executed by the FP software emulation code built into the VM.
# This configuration makes it possible to provide TCK-compilant FP
# math inside a process that's configured to run in the VFP "RunFast"
# mode. Please refer to the VM Porting Guide for more information.
#
# The gcc flags below are based on the GCC released on
# www.codesourcery.com. If you use another GCC distribution, you may
# need to change the flags.
