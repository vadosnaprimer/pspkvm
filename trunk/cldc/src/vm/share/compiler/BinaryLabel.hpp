// Labels are used to refer to (abstract) machine code locations.
// They encode a location >= 0 and a state (free, bound, linked).
// If code-relative locations are used (e.g. offsets from the
// start of the code, Labels are relocation-transparent, i.e.,
// the code can be moved around even during code generation (GC).

// Usage of Labels
//
// free  : label has not been used yet
// bound : label location has been determined, label position is
//          corresponding code offset 
// linked: label location has not been determined yet, label position is code
//          offset of last instruction referring to the label
//
// Label positions are always code offsets in order to be (code) relocation
// transparent.  Linked labels point to a chain of (linked) instructions that
// eventually need to be fixed up to point to the bound label position. Each
// instruction refers to the previous instruction that also refers to the
// same label. The last instruction in the chain (i.e., the first instruction
// to refer to the label) refers to itself.  
// 
// These instructions use pc-relative addressing and thus are relocation
// transparent.
