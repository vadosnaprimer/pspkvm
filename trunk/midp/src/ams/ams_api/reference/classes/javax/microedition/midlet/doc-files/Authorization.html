    <H1>Security for MIDP Applications</H1>
    <P>The MIDP 1.0 specification constrained each MIDlet suite to
      operate in a sandbox wherein all of the APIs available to the
      MIDlets would prevent access to sensitive APIs or functions of the
      device.  That sandbox concept is used in this specification and
      all untrusted MIDlet suites are subject to its limitations.
      Every implementation of this specification MUST support running
      untrusted MIDlet suites. </P>

    <P>MIDP introduces the concept of trusted applications that
      may be permitted to use APIs that are considered sensitive and
      are restricted.  If and when a device determines that a MIDlet
      suite can be trusted then access is allowed as indicated by the
      domain policy.  The Trusted MIDlet Suite Security section below
      describes the concepts. Any MIDlet suite that
      is not trusted by the device MUST be run as untrusted. 
      If errors occur in the process of verifying that a MIDlet suite 
      is trusted then the MIDlet suite MUST be rejected. </P> 

    <H2><A name="untrusted">Untrusted MIDlet Suites</A></H2>

    <P>An untrusted MIDlet suite is a MIDlet suite for which the
      origin and the integrity of the JAR file can NOT be
      trusted by the device. 

      Untrusted MIDlet suites MUST execute in the untrusted domain
      using a restricted
      environment where access to protected APIs or functions either
      is not allowed or is allowed with explicit user permission.

      Any MIDP 1.0 compliant MIDlet suite MUST be able to run in an
      implementation of this specification as untrusted.

      Any APIs or functions of this specification which are not
      security sensitive, having no permissions defined for them, are
      implicitly accessible by both trusted and untrusted MIDlet
      suites.

      Untrusted MIDlet suites do not request permissions explicitly in
      the JAR manifest or application descriptor.
    </P>

    <P>The untrusted domain for untrusted MIDlet suites MUST
      allow, without explicit confirmation by the user, access to:</P>

    <H2><A name="trusted">Trusted MIDlet Suite Security</A></H2>
    <P>Security for Trusted MIDlet suites is based on protection domains.
      Each protection domain defines the permissions that may be
      granted to a MIDlet suite in that domain. The protection domain
      owner specifies how the device identifies and verifies that it
      can trust a MIDlet suite and bind it to a protection domain with
      the permissions that authorize access to protected APIs or
      functions. The mechanisms the device uses to identify and trust
      MIDlet suites are defined separately to allow them to be
      selected appropriately to the device, network, and business
      case.</P>

    <P>The <A HREF="PKITrust.html">
	     Trusted MIDlet Suites Using X.509 PKI</A> describes a
      mechanism for identifying trusted MIDlet suites though signing
      and verification. If an implementation of this specification
      will recognize MIDlet suites signed using PKI as trusted MIDlet
      suites they must be signed and verified according to the formats
      and processes specified in Trusted MIDlet Using X.509 PKI.</P>

    <P>The basic authorization of a MIDlet suite is established by the

    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>A protection domain consisting of a set of
	<em>Allowed</em> and <em>User</em> permissions
      </LI>

      <LI>A set of permissions requested by the MIDlet suite  in
	  <code>MIDlet-Permissions</code> and
	  <code>MIDlet-Permissions-Opt</code> attributes

      </LI>

      <LI>A set of permissions for each protected API or function on the
	device which is a union of all permissions defined by every
	API on the device for protected functions
      </LI>
      <LI>The user who may be asked to grant permissions
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <H3>Assumptions</H3>
    <UL>
      <LI>MIDlets do not need to be aware of the
	security policy except for security exceptions that may occur when
	using APIs.
      </LI>

      <LI>A MIDlet suite is subject to a single
	protection domain and its permissible actions.
      </LI>

      <LI>The internal representation of protection domains and
	permissions is implementation specific.
      </LI>

      <LI>
	The details of how authentication results and configuration
	settings are presented to the user in the user interface are
	implementation dependent and are outside the scope of this
	specification.
      </LI>

      <LI>The device must protect the security policy and protection
	domain information stored in the device from viewing or
	modification except by authorized parties.
      </LI>

      <LI>If the security policy for a device is static and disallows
	use of some functions of the security framework then the
	implementation of unused and inaccessible security functions
	may be removed.
      </LI>

      <LI>Security policy allows an implementation to restrict access
	but MUST NOT be used to avoid implementing
	functionality. For example, unimplemented protocols under the
	Generic Connection framework MUST throw
	<CODE>ConnectionNotFoundException</CODE>.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    
    <H3><A NAME=perm>Permissions</A></H3>
    <P>Permissions are the means to protect
      access to APIs or functions which require explicit authorization
      before being invoked. Permissions described in this section only
      refer to those APIs and functions which need security protection
      and do not refer to other APIs which can be accessed by
      both trusted and untrusted MIDlet suites and do not need
      explicit permission.

      Permissions are checked by the implementation prior to
      the invocation of the protected function.
    </P>

    <P>The names of permissions have a hierarchical
      organization similar to Java package names.  The names of
      permissions are case sensitive. All of the permissions for
      an API MUST use the prefix that
      is the same as the package name of the API.  
      If the permission is for a function of a specific class in the
      package then the permission MUST include the package and classname.
      The set of valid characters for permissions is the same as that
      for package and class names.
      The conventions for use of capitalization in package names
      SHOULD be used for permission names.
      For example, <CODE>javax.microedition.io</CODE>.
      Following the permission name, whether by package or class, additional
      modifiers may be appended with a separator of
      &quot;.&quot; (Unicode U+002E).
    </P>
    <P>
      Each API in this specification that provides access to a
      protected function will define the permissions.  For APIs
      defined outside of MIDP there must be a single document that
      specifies any necessary permissions and the behavior of the API
      when it is implemented on MIDP.
    </P>

    <H3>Permissions for Protected Functions</H3>

    <P>Each function (or entire API) which was identified as protected
      must have its permission name defined in the class or package
      documentation for the API.</P>

    <P>Refer to the documentation of the
      <CODE>javax.microedition.io</CODE> package for permissions on
      all Generic Connection schemes defined in this specification.
      All APIs and functions within this specification that do not
      explicitly define permissions MUST be made available to all
      trusted and untrusted MIDlet suites.</P>

    <H3>Requesting Permissions for a MIDlet Suite</H3>
    <P>A MIDlet suite that requires access to protected APIs or
      functions must request the corresponding permissions.
      Permissions requested can be required by listing the permissions
      in the attribute <CODE>MIDlet-Permissions</CODE>. These
      permissions are critical to the function of the MIDlet suite and
      it will not operate correctly without them.</P>

    <P>If the MIDlet suite can function correctly with or
      without particular permission(s) it should request them
      using the <CODE>MIDlet-Permissions-Opt</CODE> attribute.
      The MIDlet suite is able to run
      with reduced functionality (for example, as a single player game  
      instead of a net game) without these non-critical permissions
      and MUST be installed and run.</P> 

    <P>The <CODE>MIDlet-Permissions</CODE> and
      <CODE>MIDlet-Permissions-Opt</CODE> attributes contain a list of
      one or more permissions. 
      Multiple permissions are separated by a comma (Unicode U+002C).
      Leading and trailing whitespace (Unicode U+0020) and tabs (Unicode
      U+0009) are ignored.</P> 


    <H3>Permissions on the Device</H3>
    <P>Each device that implements this specification and any other
      Java APIs will have a total set of permissions referring to
      protected APIs and functions. It is the union of all permissions
      defined by every protected function or API on the device.
    </P>

    
    <H3><A NAME=domain>Protection Domain</A></H3>

    <P>A protection domain defines a set of permissions and related
      interaction modes.  A protection domain consists of:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>a set of permissions that should be allowed (<EM>Allowed</EM>)
      </LI>
      <LI>a set of permissions that the user may authorize (<EM>User</EM>);
	each with its user interaction mode</LI>
    </UL>

    <P>Within a protection domain each permission may be either
      <EM>allowed</EM> or <EM>user</EM> but not both.
    </P>

    <P>The <em>Allowed</em> permissions are any
      permissions which explicitly allow access to a given protected
      API or function on the basis of MIDlet suite being associated with the
      protection domain.  <em>Allowed</em> permissions do not require
      any user interaction.</P>

    <P>The <em>User</em> permissions are any permissions for a
      protected API or function on the basis of MIDlet suite being
      bound to the protection domain and will allow access to
      protected API or function after the prompt given to the user and
      explicit user permission being granted.</P>


    <H3>User Permission Interaction Modes</H3>
    <P>A User Permission is defined to allow the user to deny
      permission or to grant permission to a specific API with one
      of the following interaction modes:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>"<CODE>blanket</CODE>" is valid for every invocation of an
	API by a MIDlet suite until it is uninstalled or the
	permission is changed by the user.
	
      </LI>
      <LI>"<CODE>session</CODE>" is valid from the invocation of a
	MIDlet suite until it terminates.  "<CODE>session</CODE>"
	mode MUST prompt the user on or before the first invocation 
	of the API or function which is protected.  When the user re-invokes
	the MIDlet suite the prompt MUST be repeated.
      </LI>
      <LI>"<CODE>oneshot</CODE>" MUST prompt the user on each
	invocation of the API or function which is protected.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The choice of user permission interaction modes is driven by
      the security policy and the device implementation. Each user
      permission has a default interaction mode and a set of other
      available interaction modes. The user SHOULD be presented with a
      choice of interaction modes.  The default interaction mode may
      be offered if it is supplied. The user MUST always be able to
      deny permission.
    </P>

    <P>If and when prompted, the user SHOULD be provided with a user
      friendly description of the requested permissions sufficient to
      make a well-informed choice.
    </P>

    <P>The range of blanket to oneshot action permission modes
      represents a tradeoff between usability and user notification
      and should behave smoothly and consistently with the human
      interface of the device.
    </P>


    <H3><A NAME=grant>Granting Permissions to Trusted MIDlet Suites</A></H3>
    <P>Authorization of trusted MIDlet suites uses protection
      domain information, permissions on the device, and permissions
      requested in the MIDlet suite. Permissions in the domain are
      <em>Allowed</em> or <em>User</em>. Permissions requested by the
      application are either critical or non-critical.</P>

    <P>To establish the permissions granted to a trusted MIDlet suite
      when it is to be invoked all of the following MUST be true: 
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>The MIDlet suite must have been bound to a protection domain.
      </LI>
      <LI>The requested critical permissions are retrieved from the
	attributes <CODE>MIDlet-Permissions</CODE>
        and non-critical permissions from
        <CODE>MIDlet-Permissions-Opt</CODE>.
	If these attributes appear in the application descriptor they
	MUST be identical to corresponding attributes in the manifest.
	If they are not identical, the MIDlet suite MUST NOT be
	installed or invoked.
      </LI>
      <LI>If any of the requested permissions are unknown to the
	device and are not marked as critical
	then they are removed from the requested permissions.
      </LI>
      <LI>If any of the requested permissions
	are unknown to the device and marked as critical,
	the MIDlet suite MUST NOT be installed or invoked.</LI> 
      <LI>If any of the requested
	permissions are not present in the protection domain
	(<em>Allowed</em> or <em>User</em>) permission sets
	and the requested permission was marked as critical
	then the MIDlet suite does not have sufficient authorization and
	MUST NOT be installed or invoked. 
      </LI>
      <LI>If any of the requested permissions are not present in the
	protection domain (<em>Allowed</em> or <em>User</em>) permission sets,
	and the requested permissions are not
	marked as critical, the application MUST still be installed
	and MUST be able to be invoked by the user. 
      </LI>
      <LI>If any of the requested
	permissions match the <EM>User</EM> permissions of the
	protection domain then 
	the user MUST explicitly provide authorization to grant those
	permissions to the MIDlet suite. The implementation is
	responsible for making the request to the user and getting the
	response to allow or deny the request.
      </LI>
      <LI>The permissions granted to the
	MIDlet suite are the intersection of the requested permissions with
	the union of the allowed and user granted permissions.
      </LI>
      <LI>During execution, any protected APIs MUST check for the
	appropriate permissions and throw a
	<CODE>SecurityException</CODE> if the permission has not been
	granted.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>The successful result of
      authorization is that the MIDlet suite is granted access to
      protected APIs or functions for which it requested permissions.</P>

    <H3><A NAME="policyfile">Example External Domain Policy Format</A></H3>
    <P>An external representation for protection domains allows 
      clear communication between developers, operators and
      manufacturers. This format is provided only as an example. There
      is no requirement for an implementation of 
      this specification to use this format.  The
      policy file character set is UTF-8 encoding of Unicode to
      support any language.  The policy file syntax is based on the
      JAR manifest format.
    </P>

    <P>A policy consists of the definitions of domains and aliases.
      Each domain consists of the definition of granted permissions
      and user permissions.
      Aliases permit groups of named permissions to be reused in more
      than one domain and helps keep the policy compact.
      Aliases may only be defined and used within a single policy file.
      References to an alias MUST follow the definition of the alias
      in the policy file.
    </P>

    <P>A domain is defined with a domain identifier and a sequence of
      permissions. The domain identifier is implementation specific.
      Each permission line begins with
      "<CODE>allow</CODE>" or user permissions "<CODE>blanket</CODE>",
      "<CODE>session</CODE>", or "<CODE>oneshot</CODE>" to indicate
      the interaction level for the list of permissions that follow.
      User permissions may also include a default mode.
      Multiple permission lines are allowed.  The permissions are
      processed in order and if a permission occurs multiple times
      within a domain only the last definition of the permission is
      used. It is not recommended that permissions appear more than
      once.
