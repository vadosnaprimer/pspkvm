/**
 * Interface for predictive text processing
 *
 * This class is responsible for initializing the Dictionary
 * Two APIs are required,
 *  addWord : An interface to add a word to current dictionary (if supported)
 *  iterator: Get a iterator object with the following methods
 *          iterator.next()        : get next possible completion string
 *          iterator.hasNext()     : check if another possible completion exists
 *          iterator.nextLevel(int key) : add a char to the current completion
 *          iterator.provLevel()   : backspace last char from current completion
 *          iterator.reset()       : clear current completion
 *          iteratr.resetNext()    : revert to first possible completion string
 *
 * Example of using the predictive text API:
 *
 *      PTDictionary dictionary;
 *      PTIterator iter=dictionary.iterator();
 *      iter.nextLevel('2');
 *      iter.nextLevel('2');
 *      iter.nextLevel('2');
 *      while(iter.hasNext()) {
 *          String completion=iter.next();
 *          System.out.println(completion);
 *          //will print "aca" (short of "academy") "cab" (short of "cabin"), 
 *          // "acc" (short of "accelerate") etc.
 *      }
