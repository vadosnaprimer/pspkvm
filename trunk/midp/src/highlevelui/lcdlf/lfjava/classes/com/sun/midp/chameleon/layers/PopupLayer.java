/**
 * A "Popup" layer is a special kind of layer which can
 * also have commands associated with it. When a popup
 * layer is added to a MIDPWindow, its commands (if it has any)
 * can be accessed through the soft button bar. If a popup layer
 * does have commands associated with it, any commands on the
 * current displayable/item are no longer accessible. If
 * the popup layer does not have its own commands, any
 * existing commands from the displayable/item remain.
 *
 * NOTE: For now, a PopupLayer is also always visible,
 * that is isVisible() always returns true. To control the
 * visibility of a PopupLayer, you add it and remove it
 * from a MIDPWindow. IMPL_NOTE: determine if a relationship between
 * PopupLayer and MIDPWindow can allow non visible popup layers.
