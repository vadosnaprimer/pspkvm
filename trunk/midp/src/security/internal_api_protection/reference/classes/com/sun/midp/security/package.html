 Classes that allow trust to be given to MIDlet suites and internal classes.
<p>
 All MIDP applications are "untrusted" unless otherwise setup to have some
 explicit trust, this is done by giving each MIDlet suite it's own
 resources and not allowing access to or "see" other suites resources.</p>
<p>
 However, while restricting access to resources MIDP must also:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable an internal class to perform a larger set of actions than the
    suite using it</li>

<li>Enable a "trusted" suite to perform a larger set of actions than
    "untrusted" suites</li>
</ol><p>
 The first feature depends on the <code>MIDletSuiteLoader</code> class and
 <code>SecurityToken</code> class. <code>MIDletSuiteLoader</code>, being the
 first class
 running in the VM is implicitly trusted to create and issue 
 <code>SecurityToken</code> objects to the internal classes that need them.
 Restricted internal methods take a <code>SecurityToken</code> as an extra
 argument, which they check before performing their task. A "untrusted" MIDlet
 cannot get a <code>SecurityToken</code> object on its own so it will be
 restricted.</p>

<p>
 The second feature is depends on the <code>Scheduler</code> class,
 <code>MIDletSuite</code> interface, and <code>Installer</code> class. The
 <code>Scheduler</code> is anchor of trust, from which a restricted public
 method can get the interface to scheduled suite and check to see if the suite
 is permitted perform the action. The <code>Installer</code> class determines
 if a suite is "trusted".</p>
